Our disposition\r\nduring challenging moments as believers\r\ntestifies to our level of faith in God. This\r\nstatement reminds us of the story of\r\nPrince Omodaro Andrew who was born into a Christian home. He had the opportunity to attend one of the most popular and\r\nexpensive private primary and secondary schools in town. His parents succeeded in\r\nbringing him up in the way and fear of God, so, he became dedicated to the things of\r\nGod early in life. Consequently, they were careful about his choice of friends and\r\nactivities from time to time. After his secondary education, he had the opportunity to\r\ntravel outside the country for further studies. Unfortunately, he soon forgot both his\r\nmoral and spiritual training and was negatively influenced by the culture of the people\r\nsimply because he was no longer under the tutelage of his parents. Eventually, he\r\nabandoned his studies and got involved in internet scam and other evil vices that\r\nfinally led him to jail.  <\/p>  <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n\r\n        <p>    The topic of today focuses on Daniel and how he refused to compromise his faith\r\nin God when he was taken captive to Babylon, the year King Nebuchadnezzar\r\nconquered Jerusalem. Daniel and his friends were found to be qualified for\r\nrecruitment into the service of the King of Babylon. Daniel found himself in a foreign\r\nland, but he refused to be influenced by the evil practices of the people. Instead, he\r\nmaintained his spiritual maturity and demonstrated unreserved loyalty to God by\r\nrefusing to defile himself with the royal food, even though it was his right. The topic\r\nshall be discussed in three sub-headings.    <\/p>  <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n\r\n\r\n        <h4>THE LESSON EXPLAINED<\/h4>\r\n\r\n        <ol type=\"A\">\r\n\r\n        <li> <!-- FIRST CHECK THE NUMBER OF LESSON EXPLAINED, THEN COPY THIS PART FOR THE NUMBER OF TIMES  -->\r\n\r\n        <h5> Daniel's Resolution Daniel 1:8-14  <\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\r\n\r\n        <p> In the year King Nebuchadnezzar conquered Jerusalem, he ordered that some of the\r\nIsraelites from the royal family be brought to Babylon to serve in the king\\'s palace.\r\nDaniel and his friends were among the captives. They were to be fed with the king\\'s\r\nfood and wine and trained for three years before they could qualify to enter the king\\'s\r\nservice (vv. 1-5). According to verse 8, Daniel was faced with the dilemma of whether\r\nor not to comply with the royal order, especially when he knew that the Babylonian\r\nfood must have been prepared and dedicated to their gods and, therefore, was not\r\ngood for an Israelite like him (Deuteronomy 14:3-21) because it could cause\r\ndefilement. Daniel resolved to stick to the commands of God rather than defile\r\nhimself with the royal food and wine (v. 8). Therefore, he wisely negotiated with the\r\nchief official for permission to be exempted from the king\\'s food but to have a ten-day\r\ntrial of vegetarian diet. Nevertheless, the Lord granted Daniel favour and the official\r\nagreed to test Daniel and three other Hebrew young men for ten days only on\r\nvegetable meals. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n\r\n        <p> However, we should know that Daniel was not a rebel who just wanted to defy\r\nthe order of a constituted authority for his personal gains. Of course, he knew that his\r\ncompromise would result to defilement as an Israelite, so, he was resolute. He humbly\r\npersuaded the guard to test them for ten days only on vegetable meals. His persistence\r\nin pursuing what is pleasing to God is commendable and worthy of emulation. Of course, Daniel knew the consequences of his resolution and he was ready to face it\r\ninstead of compromising his faith. Likewise, believers today should strive to hold on\r\nto their faith and not give up when they are faced with some life-threatening\r\nsituations, knowing that God will provide a way of escape like He did for Daniel, who\r\nwas promoted in a foreign land. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n\r\n\r\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li>Why did Daniel refuse to take the royal food and wine? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\r\n        <li> What are the things that can be likened to royal delicacies in our contemporary\r\ntime that Christians should avoid? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\r\n        <li> Discuss Daniel's source of boldness. <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 3-->\r\n        <\/ol>\r\n\r\n        <\/li>\r\n\r\n\r\n<li> <!-- FIRST CHECK THE NUMBER OF LESSON EXPLAINED, THEN COPY THIS PART FOR THE NUMBER OF TIMES  -->\r\n\r\n        <h5> Daniel's Convincing Result\r\nDaniel 1:15-16 <\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\r\n\r\n        <p> The fact has been established that God made Daniel and his friends to find favour in\r\nthe sight of Ashpenaz who allowed them to live on vegetable meals instead of the\r\nking\\'s delicacies. Subsequently, after ten days, there was a convincing result. When\r\nDaniel and his friends were assessed and compared with those who took the royal\r\ndelicacies, they were found healthier and better nourished than the others who lived\r\non the royal diet. Without doubt, the guard was convinced that Daniel and his friends\r\nhad done well with their vegetarian diet. Therefore, he completely withdrew the royal\r\nfood and wine from them. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n\r\n        <p> One can imagine how Daniel and the other Israelite young men felt after they\r\nrealised that the ten-day diet trial made a difference after all. The great lesson is that\r\nDaniel dared to be different when it was actually difficult to do so, especially in a\r\nforeign land. It is not uncommon that some believers suffer great loss because of their\r\nfaith in the Lord, like Stephen, who was stoned to death and other apostles. No wonder\r\nPaul said, \"I consider that our present sufferings are not worth comparing with the\r\nglory that will be revealed in us\" (Romans 8:18). In other words, whatever we lose as a\r\nresult of our faith is temporary because, like He did for Daniel, the Lord will reward us\r\naccordingly. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n\r\n\r\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> As a Christian public servant, what would you do if you are constantly denied\r\npromotion because you refused to compromise the standard of the Bible? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\r\n        <li> How can Christian artisans demonstrate sincere faith in their dealings with their\r\nclients in their bid to make profit? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\r\n        <li> What is your counsel for a Christian student who has consistently failed an\r\nexamination and finally had a free offer of supply of answers to examination\r\nquestions (\\'expo\\')? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 3-->\r\n        <\/ol>\r\n\r\n        <\/li>\r\n\r\n\r\n<li> <!-- FIRST CHECK THE NUMBER OF LESSON EXPLAINED, THEN COPY THIS PART FOR THE NUMBER OF TIMES  -->\r\n\r\n        <h5> Daniel's Amazing Reward\r\nDaniel 1:17-21 <\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\r\n\r\n        <p> One of the attributes of God is that He rewards faithfulness like the case of Daniel and\r\nhis friends who sought to please Him above pleasure, personal gratification and royal\r\nesteem. According to the passage, God had blessed these young men with\r\n\"knowledge and understanding of all kinds of literature and learning\u201d (Daniel 1:17).\r\nThey quickly mastered the Babylonian language and became experts. Specifically,\r\nDaniel was gifted in the understanding and interpretation of all kinds of dreams and\r\nvisions by divine revelation. When they were presented to the king for appraisal, he\r\nfound that no one was equal to Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, so they were\r\nqualified and entered into the king\\'s service. Furthermore, the king found the young\r\nmen ten times better in matters of wisdom and understanding than the magicians and\r\nthe enchanters in the whole kingdom (v. 20). Daniel lived long and remained in office\r\nuntil the first year of King Cyrus. His faithfulness was rewarded as he worked with\r\nNebuchadnezzar, Belshazzar, Darius and Cyrus (Daniel 1:21; 6:28). <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n\r\n        <p> Daniel and his friends were exemplary in their relationship with God. Although\r\nthey were in a foreign land, they knew their God and remained faithful to Him.\r\nTherefore, the challenge is that believers should be ready to obey God rather than\r\npeople, even when the situation is criticallike the case of Daniel and his friends. We\r\nshould always seek to obey God not minding the consequences. Worthy of note in the\r\npassage also is the fact that the three years of waiting, serving and perseverance by\r\nthese youths who chose to obey God despite the danger they found themselves was\r\nrewarded with promotion and prominence. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n\r\n\r\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> Does God\\'s laws have direct effect on our day-to-day living?

He is known for\r\nhis piety and dedication at home, office\r\nand in church. He has been praying and\r\nbelieving God for promotion to the post\r\nof a sales manager in one of the new\r\nbranches in the North East. Having been\r\ninterviewed, he emerged the best\r\nqualified and experienced candidate for the position. The only problem was that he was given an option of joining a cult before\r\nthe promotion will be effected. Although some friends and even his wife persuaded\r\nhim to accept the option because of the benefits attached to it, Mr Effiong vowed\r\nnever to compromise his faith for the sake of money or position. How will you\r\ndescribe Mr Effiong?   <\/p>  <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n\r\n        <p>    The story above pictures the nature of our journey of faith in God. It is\r\nsometimes full of all kinds of temptations that can easily lead believers into sin,\r\nespecially those who are not bold enough to demonstrate their faith in God.\r\nNevertheless, God has empowered us to resist all forms of temptations with the\r\nboldness that we have in Christ, like the Hebrew young men in today\\'s passage.\r\nInstead of fear and intimidation, the three young men expressed bold faith in God\r\neven in the face of challenges.    <\/p>  <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n\r\n        \r\n        <h4>THE LESSON EXPLAINED<\/h4>\r\n\r\n        <ol type=\"A\">\r\n\r\n        <li> <!-- FIRST CHECK THE NUMBER OF LESSON EXPLAINED, THEN COPY THIS PART FOR THE NUMBER OF TIMES  -->\r\n        \r\n        <h5> A Death Sentence\r\nDaniel 3:19-23  <\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> King Nebuchadnezzar was a powerful king who demanded total loyalty to his\r\ncommands throughout his domain. He made a gold statue and set it up in the province\r\nof Babylon with the command that everyone must worship it. The penalty for\r\n__\r\ndisobedience was death sentence that individual will immediately be thrown into a\r\nblazing furnace (vv. 1-6). The king issued a decree to authenticate the order but\r\nShadrach, Meshach and Abednego who have been true to their faith in God publicly\r\ndeclared their unwillingness to compromise their faith and bow to a graven image (vv.\r\n16-18). Of course, the three Hebrew young men who refused to bow to the golden\r\nimage of the king put their lives on the line. In rage, the king ordered that the intensity\r\nof the fire be increased seven times over. These men were bound and thrown into the\r\nfurnace with their robes on, by some soldiers. However, these men stayed with their\r\nconvictions and never compromised. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> The faith and lifestyle of the three Hebrew men in a foreign land is worthy of\r\nemulation. Even though they knew the consequences of their resolution, they were\r\nnot ready to worship the golden image of King Nebuchadnezzar. They were bold\r\n__\r\nbecause they knew their God they knew that it is more rewarding to obey God rather\r\nthan human beings, even when threatened with death penalty. It is obvious that if they\r\nhad bowed to the golden image because they did not want to die in the blazing\r\nfurnace, they would have still died perhaps a more horrible death without becoming\r\nheroes. Christians are, therefore, encouraged to be bold in exercising their faith, no\r\nmatter the conspiracy from the kingdom of darkness. The assurance we have is that\r\nGod will always provide a way of escape for His children.  <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> Why does God sometimes let His people experience suffering or hardship? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\r\n        <li> Discuss the reasons why the three Hebrews preferred to be thrown into the furnace\r\nto bowing down and worshipping the golden image.<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\r\n        <li> What can make believers compromise their faith today?

According to\r\nverses 24 and 25, the king was troubled when he saw a fourth image (like a son of the\r\ngods) and that they were unhurt. In amazement, he went to the door of the blazing fire\r\nand called out Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego addressing them as \"servants of the\r\nMost High God\" (v. 26). Apparently, their miraculous deliverance from the fire\r\nattracted the attention of all the princes, governors, lieutenant-governors and other\r\nofficials of the king; they all saw and confirmed their miraculous escape.\r\nInterestingly, not even their hair or clothes were burnt and there was no smell of\r\nsmoke on them (v. 27). In his response in verse 28, the king sang to the praise of the\r\nGod of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego who sent His angel to rescue the three\r\nyoung men from the blazing fire. Eventually, the king testified to their unreserved\r\nloyalty to their God and how they risked their lives rather than bowing down and\r\nworshipping the image. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> Whenever Christians hold to their faith without compromise, God always\r\nprovides a way of escape like He did for the three Hebrew men who demonstrated\r\nboldness and faith in Him for deliverance. The experience of the young men\r\nultimately translated to an opportunity for the king to acknowledge the powerful\r\nnature of the God of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego before the \\'honourables\\' of the\r\nBabylonian empire. In fact, King Nebuchadnezzar himself became their \\'interpreter\\'\r\nwho translated their action to words. The king praised the God of the three Hebrew\r\nmen and declared that God\\'s angels rescued them. He also affirmed that their faith was\r\nworth dying for (Daniel 3:28). The implication, therefore, is that our disposition to\r\nlife\u2019s challenges, especially as Christians, matters to God greatly and more\r\nimportantly, it can be a means of spreading the Gospel to unbelievers. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> Discuss how being bold about your faith can draw others to God. <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\r\n        <li> Why do some believers easily give up in the face of persecution?

Suddenly, they began to\r\nexperience strange things that bothered\r\nthe minds of the people, especially the\r\nelderly who had witnessed God\\'s\r\nfaithfulness in time past. As they\r\ncontinued to pray for deliverance, it was\r\nrevealed that they needed to pray and intercede on behalf of the community. Without delay, they set aside some days for\r\nprayer, fasting and confession of their known and unknown sins; asking for God\\'s\r\nforgiveness. It was said that God answered their prayers and the people began to live\r\ntheir normal lives.   <\/p>  <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n\r\n        <p>      Today\\'s topic centres on Daniel\u2019s prayer based on the word of God given to\r\nJeremiah. Before this time, Daniel had an understanding from the Scriptures that the\r\ndesolation of Jerusalem would last for seventy years. Therefore, he turned to the Lord\r\nGod and offered a prayer of help to Him on behalf of his people, Israel. The prayer was\r\ncharacterised by praise, confession and petition to God. His prayer was with humility,\r\nprecision, as he acknowledged God\\'s past deeds among them.  <\/p>  <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n\r\n        \r\n        <h4>THE LESSON EXPLAINED<\/h4>\r\n\r\n        <ol type=\"A\">\r\n\r\n        <li>\r\n        \r\n        <h5> A Sincere Confession of Sins\r\nDaniel 9:4-8 <\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> In the first year of the reign of Darius, son of Xerxes, Daniel understood from the\r\nScriptures, according to the word of the Lord given to Prophet Jeremiah, that the\r\ncaptivity which was then drawing near would last seventy years. Upon the discovery,\r\nDaniel prayed earnestly to the Lord God; he fasted, wore sackcloth and sat on ashes as\r\nsigns of mourning (vv. 2-3) and confessed the sins his people. The content of his\r\nprayer beginning from verse 4 can be analysed as:\r\n\r\n<\/p><ul>\r\n<li> He acknowledged God as great and awesome - One who keeps His covenant of\r\nlove with all who love and obey Him commands. <\/li>\r\n<li> He acknowledged the sins and wickedness of the people without exonerating\r\nhimself. <\/li>\r\n<li> He acknowledged that the people did not listen to the prophets who spoke to their\r\nkings and fathers. <\/li>\r\n<li> He confessed that all the men in Judah and the people of Jerusalem are covered\r\nwith shame because of their unfaithfulness to God <\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n  <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> It should be noted that Daniel did not exonerate himself from the sins of his\r\npeople. He acknowledged their short-comings, identified with his people and their\r\nsins using the collective pronoun \\'we\\'. It is obvious that Daniel was sincere in his\r\nassessment of their status in the light of God\\'s righteousness. He did not accuse God\r\nor his people. Rather, he admitted that their predicament was as a result of their own\r\nunfaithfulness and rebellion to God. According to the New International Version\r\nCommentary, Daniel\\'s prayer can be classified into worship, confession and petition.\r\nThe lesson, therefore, is that Christians should not always apportion blame to people,\r\nespecially in times of difficulty. Instead, they should be ready to identify with them\r\nand their sins and, therefore, play the role of an intercessor like Daniel. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n        \r\n               <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> Should a Christian who is in right standing with God bother about generational\r\nsins? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\r\n        <li> What is your understanding of the doctrine of inherited guilt, based on Exodus\r\n20:5-6; 34:6-7? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\r\n        \r\n        <\/ol>\r\n\r\n        <\/li>\r\n\r\n <li>\r\n        \r\n        <h5> An Appeal to God\\'s Faithfulness\r\nDaniel 9:15-16 <\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> Daniel was a great intercessor. Having acknowledged their sins with a contrite heart,\r\nhe pleaded for God\\'s intervention. He, thereafter, referred to God\\'s righteous acts\r\nwhen He brought His people out of Egypt and, therefore, made for Himself a name\r\nthat endures forever. In verse 15b he stated categorically, \"... we have sinned, we have\r\ndone wrong.\" In recognition of their sinful acts, he appealed to God to turn away His\r\nwrath and anger from Jerusalem (v. 16). His appeal centred on the fact that the sins and\r\niniquities of their fathers have made Jerusalem and God\\'s people an object of ridicule\r\nto other nations, thereby bringing dishonour to His holy Name. Obviously, Daniel\r\nunderstood that God punishes sinners up to the fourth generation; however, He also\r\nforgives wickedness, rebellion and sins (Exodus 34:7). He, therefore, appealed to\r\nGod to turn away His anger so that Jerusalem will no longer be an object of ridicule. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> Daniel\\'s ability to recall the faithful deeds of God among His people in the past\r\nreinforced his faith in God\\'s ability to show Himself faithful again. In his appeal,\r\nDaniel described Jerusalem as God\\'s city and holy hill, though the people\r\ncontinuously rebelled against God and His commands and, therefore, deserved to be\r\npunished. However, Daniel\\'s concern was that God\\'s well-revered name should not be\r\nprofaned among the Gentile nations, thereby bringing shame and reproach to His holy\r\nName. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> Why did Daniel not recount his personal deeds of righteousness in this prayer?\r\nWhat does it teach about leaders? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\r\n        <li> What can we do when we have discovered generational issues that may hinder\r\nour progress?

Having\r\nidentified their problem as a nation, he then made his request for mercy known to God.\r\nHe said, \"Now, our God, hear the prayers and petitions of your servant. For your sake\r\nO Lord, look with favour on your desolate sanctuary.\" (v. 17) In fact, verse 19 is a\r\nsummary of his prayer of petition as he asked the Lord to listen, forgive, hear and act.\r\nHe, however, acknowledged the fact that his request was based on the integrity of God\r\nand not the righteousness of the people. Furthermore, His city and people bear His Name (v. 19b), which must be carefully protected among the heathen nations. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> Daniel demonstrated one of the qualities of a good leader who had the interest of\r\nhis people at heart. His prayer was specific and concise that: God will hear his prayers\r\nand petitions and restore the desolation of Jerusalem because of His mercy (v. 18).\r\nDaniel\\'s cry for divine intervention is worthy of emulation. As a godly leader, he was\r\nable to identify the wrongdoing of his people and proffer the best solution (God\\'s\r\nintervention). This implies that whenever we acknowledge and understand God\\'s\r\nWord as believers, we can be led to sincere repentance that will pave way for answered\r\nprayers whenever we sin against God, either as a nation, family or individuals. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> Analyse the prayer of Daniel, identifying the major features and how that can\r\ninform your own prayer according to your individual situations. <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\r\n        <li> How would you describe leaders who often apportion blames instead of\r\ninterceding on behalf of their people? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\r\n        \r\n        <\/ol>\r\n\r\n        <\/li>\r\n\r\n        <\/ol>\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h4> Prayer Points <\/h4>\r\n        <ul>\r\n        <li> Pray that God should help you to understand His Word and cause you to discover\r\nthe hidden truth therein. <\/li> <!-- Prayer Point 1-->\r\n        <li> Pray that God should help you to understand His Word and cause you to discover\r\nthe hidden truth therein. <\/li> <!-- Prayer Point 2-->\r\n        <li> Pray for the restoration of our nation for the glory of God. <\/li> <!-- Prayer Point 3-->\r\n        <\/ul>\r\n\r\n             <h4> Fellowship and Ministry Building Activities <\/h4>\r\n        <ul>\r\n        <li> Recall the wonderful deeds of God in your lives, families, church or nation and\r\ncompose a song of thanksgiving. <\/li> <!-- Fellowship Activity 1-->\r\n        <li> Identify collective sins in your community\/family.

However, rather than\r\nhaving a progressive process, her\r\ndilation was static for unknown reasons.\r\nAs the woman relaxed at intervals, the\r\nnurses urged and pleaded with her not to\r\ngive up because that may be dangerous\r\nfor her and her unborn baby.\r\nUnfortunately, the more she tried to\r\nmake progress, the more she\r\nencountered difficulty. Immediately the medical team concluded that she could not have the baby on her own, thus, they made\r\nan alternative arrangement for her in order to save her life and her baby.     <\/p>  <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n\r\n        <p>   In our text today, the experience of Daniel can be likened to the story of the\r\nwoman, as narrated above. As a prayer warrior, Daniel had fasted and mourned for\r\nthree weeks over the sins of his people. He had travailed in prayer for God's\r\nintervention on behalf of His people but it seemed no answer was forthcoming.\r\nUltimately, his physical strength failed and he became weak just like the woman in the\r\nstory. He was in this state when he saw the vision of a man who touched and\r\nstrengthened him. In other words, Daniel was encouraged to have strong faith in God\r\nand be courageous. The man revealed to him his plans to fight against the prince of\r\nPersia so that the prince of Greece will come (v. 20). Nevertheless, those who were\r\nwith him did not see anyone but they were overwhelmed with terror and so, they hid\r\nthemselves. Delay in receiving answers to our prayers is not only common to people\r\nof old. Even today, believers still experience delay in receiving answers to their\r\nprayers that may have been hindered by evil forces. But one thing is sure, God is\r\nalways ready to fight our battles and give us victory, especially those who have strong\r\nfaith in Him.     <\/p>  <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n\r\n        \r\n        <h4>THE LESSON EXPLAINED<\/h4>\r\n\r\n        <ol type=\"A\">\r\n\r\n        <li>\r\n        \r\n        <h5> A Message for Daniel\r\nDaniel 10:10-14  <\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> In the third year of Cyrus, king of Persia, Daniel had a revelation concerning a great\r\nwar. Consequently, his response was quick and astonishing. He decided to mourn for a\r\nperiod of three weeks without food or wine (vv. 1-2). During this period, he saw a man\r\nthat looked like an angel who said to him, \"Do not be afraid, Daniel. Since the first day\r\nthat you set your mind to gain understanding and to humble yourself before your God,\r\nyour words were heard and I have come in response to them. But the prince of the\r\nPersian kingdom resisted me twenty-one days ...\" (vv. 12-13). The testimony of\r\nDaniel\\'s experience was that God intervened as one of the chief princes (Michael)\r\ncame to rescue him. The message to him was clear and concise and that it was for an\r\nappointed time (v. 14). The angel's message to Daniel was an assurance and a\r\nconfirmation that:\r\n<\/p><ul>\r\n<li>He was greatly loved by God despite the delay in receiving answers to his prayers.<\/li>\r\n<li>His prayers have been heard since the first day he began to seek the face of God.<\/li>\r\n<li>The prince of Persia was the reason for the seeming delay in receiving answers to\r\nhis prayer before the intervention of Michael, one of the chief princes.<\/li>\r\n<li>The vision was for the future.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n  <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> Notable in the passage is that although Daniel was greatly loved of God, he\r\nexperienced delay in receiving answers to his prayers. Nevertheless Daniel did not\r\ngive up in the place of prayer and fasting, a show of strong faith in God. In contrast, \r\nsome believers today give up or are in the habit of blaming God for not responding to\r\ntheir prayers despite their commitment to His work. As Daniel persisted, God\r\nintervened, and his prayers were answered. Note that answers to our prayers may be\r\nhindered but we must \u201cpray continually\u201d (1 Thessalonians 5:17) and ask until our joy\r\nis full (John 16:24). The reason is that our prayer is both a communion with God and a\r\nspiritual warfare (Ephesians 6:10-12, 18), which should be offered in righteousness\r\nand with strong faith in God.<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> What are the indications that Daniel was greatly loved by God? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\r\n        <li> Should the prayer of believers be hindered by any force whatsoever? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\r\n        <li> How can we sustain our faith today when we are faced with the challenges of\r\nseeming unanswered prayer or delayed answers to prayer?<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 3-->\r\n        <\/ol>\r\n\r\n        <\/li>\r\n        \r\n                <li>\r\n        \r\n        <h5> Divine Strength for Daniel Daniel 10:15-19 <\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> Daniel's response to the vision is remarkable. At the appearance of the angel, he\r\nbowed and remained speechless as a sign of reverence to God. Suddenly, the angel\r\ntouched him and he started to speak. He said to the angel. \"I am overcome with\r\nanguish because of the vision, my lord, and I am helpless\" (v. 16b). Thereafter, he\r\nconfessed his unworthiness to speak with him (the angel) and his loss of physical\r\nstrength. According to verse 18, Daniel was touched again by the angel and that\r\nbrought restoration and renewed strength he needed for that moment. The angel said\r\nto him, \"Do not be afraid, O man highly esteemed ... Peace! Be strong now; be\r\nstrong.\" (v. 19) and immediately, he was strengthened. In the same vein, the Lord\r\nstretched out His hand and touched the lips of Jeremiah and put His words in his\r\nmouth, when he complained of his inadequacies upon receiving the call of God as a\r\nprophet to minister to His people (Jeremiah 1:9). <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> It is natural for people to consider their limitations, especially when they are called\r\nto serve thus they give different excuses, unlike Daniel who was open to divine touch\r\nthrough the angelic ministration. Even though we are weak as humans, we often\r\nforget that God who has called us is capable of empowering us for the ministry, no\r\nmatter the challenges. It should be noted that Daniel's walk with God, and not his\r\nesteemed position in Babylon was responsible for the angel's statement: \u201c... you are\r\nhighly esteemed\u201d (vv. 11, 19). No doubt that he remained an ideal man of God who\r\ndemonstrated his unbending faith, even in the face of persecution. He was\r\nstrengthened after the touch of the angel before he declared the purpose of his visit \r\nwhich was to reveal what is written in the Book of Truth (v. 20). Christians should\r\nrecognise the role\/ministry of angels in our daily living, but we must be careful not to\r\nworship them. Afterward, his reference to the angel as 'lord' was not an act of worship,\r\nwhich is due to the Lord only (Deuteronomy 6:4), but as God's messenger. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> What\/who is the source of believers' strength today? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\r\n        <li> What was responsible for Daniel's bowing down and speechlessness?

She is known to\r\nbe pious, responsible and has\r\nvowed to keep her virginity until her\r\nwedding night. She had prayed and\r\nwaited fervently for a life partner without\r\nresult. While observing her quiet time one\r\nmorning, she received a message from\r\nGod to fix her wedding date even though\r\nshe was not yet engaged. After due\r\nconsultation with her church pastor, she\r\nobeyed and acted accordingly.       <\/p>  <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n\r\n        <p>   Some months later, a brother who\r\nhad prayed and was convinced of God's\r\nleading to marry sister Grace started to\r\ndevelop interest in her. However, he\r\nlacked the courage to make his intention\r\nknown to her until there was an intermediary. When they both visited their pastor and told him their intention to\r\nmaintain the wedding date, their pastor concluded that the brother had faith based on his\r\nconviction but lacked action. Nevertheless, the wedding took place as scheduled and\r\nGod's name was glorified. Little wonder some people have defined faith as the proof of\r\nwhat we have not seen but we believe will be because God is involved. Apart from the\r\nfact that faith in God is an important aspect of Christianity, such faith can be described as\r\ndead if not translated into action. The author of the book of James wrote to those who had\r\naccepted the doctrine of justification by faith, yet were not living right. He made it clear\r\nto them that faith can only be proven and developed when we act on it; else, it is a dead\r\nfaith. The focal point of today's lesson is the importance of proving our faith with\r\ncorresponding actions of obedience or deeds and not mere words.     <\/p>  <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n\r\n        \r\n        <h4>THE LESSON EXPLAINED<\/h4>\r\n\r\n        <ol type=\"A\">\r\n\r\n        <li>\r\n        \r\n        <h5> Faith and Actions Examined James 2:14-17  <\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> James was aware of the discrimination that existed in the church between the rich and the\r\npoor and responded accordingly. He carefully examined the difference between faith and\r\naction. He opened chapter 2 with a warning against prejudice or favouritism, whereby\r\nthe rich are given preferential treatment at the expense of the poor. He made it clear that it\r\nis pointless for Christians to say they have faith if their actions do not prove it (v. 14)\r\nbecause such faith cannot save them. According to verses 15 and 16, if anyone has the\r\nability to meet the physical needs of another person and fails to do so, his\/her faith is\r\nuseless. Such faith, according to the author, is dead because it is not accompanied by\r\naction or deed (v. 17). In contrast, whenever we give food to the hungry, water to the\r\nthirsty, and clothes to the naked, we are demonstrating living faith through our action. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> As believers, we have the obligation to care and meet the needs of people around\r\nus, no matter who they are. This is what is known as practical or living faith (Galatians\r\n6:10). We have those who are blessed with material resources in our churches, yet are\r\nindifferent to the plight of the underprivileged. The understanding of James is that\r\nsuch people have dead faith, no matter what they profess or the level of their spiritual\r\nmaturity. This implies that one of the ways we can prove our faith is by meeting the\r\nneeds of people around us (action). We can give out food items, clothes in good\r\ncondition, textbooks and other possessions. We can also prove our faith by showing\r\nconcern for the sick and lonely around us. It is sad to note, however, that some rich\r\npeople find it difficult to identify with the needy while a few others prefer to be begged\r\nbefore they render help. It is our responsibility to identify with the needy, whether\r\nthey request or not. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> Why do some rich people find it difficult to help their fellow believers who are in need?<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\r\n        <li> Discuss some of the ways the church can be practically involved in helping the needy?<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\r\n        <li> How will the needy feel if neglected when there are people around them who can render help?<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 3-->\r\n        <\/ol>\r\n\r\n        <\/li>\r\n\r\n <li>\r\n        \r\n        <h5> Faith without Works Is Dead James 2:18-24 <\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> The author of the book of James pointed out that faith without deeds is dead. Precisely\r\nin verse 18b he states, \"Show me your faith without deeds, and I will show you my faith\r\nby what I do.\" The evidence of one's faith is the manifestation of good deeds done. He\r\nillustrated the difference between a dead and living faith with the example of\r\nAbraham who was considered righteous because he was ready to obey God's\r\ncommand and offer his son, Isaac, on the altar of sacrifice (v. 21). Consequently, his\r\nfaith and action worked together because his faith was made perfect through his\r\naction. Therefore, '... the scripture was fulfilled that says, \"Abraham believed God,\r\nand it was credited to him as righteousness,\" and he was called God's friend.' (v. 23)\r\nThe author concluded that one can only be justified by what he does and not\r\nnecessarily by faith alone; otherwise such faith will be regarded as dead because it\r\ndoes not produce anything. A living faith is usually accompanied by a corresponding\r\naction of obedience to the Word of God like the example of Abraham. It is an active\r\nfaith that produces results by obedience to God or response to the needs of others.\r\nTherefore, our profession and corresponding actions show that we have faith;\r\nanything contrary is lack of faith __ otherwise called dead faith. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> Why do some Christians struggle to put their faith into action?<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\r\n        <li> Why is dead faith worthless and of no value?<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\r\n        <\/ol>\r\n\r\n        <\/li>\r\n        \r\n         <li>\r\n        \r\n        <h5> An Example of a Living Faith James 2:25-26 <\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> Apart from the example of Abraham who had a living faith, as shown in his complete\r\nobedience to God's command, James also made reference to the faith of Rahab, the\r\nprostitute, who welcomed the Israelite spies and helped them to escape from their\r\n__\r\nenemies (Joshua 4 8). Eventually, she was put right with God through her actions.\r\nBecause Abraham and Rahab demonstrated living faith by obedience to God and the\r\nspies respectively, they have become part of the heroes\/heroine of faith (Hebrews\r\n11:11, 31). Over and again, the author made a comparison between living and dead\r\nfaith. According to verse 26 he wrote, \"As the body without the spirit is dead, so faith\r\nwithout deeds is dead.\" Invariably, faith and works are inseparable just as our faith\r\ncannot be a living faith when we are not willing to obey God's Word. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> God expects us to walk by faith because without faith it is impossible to please\r\nHim (Hebrews 11:6). It is important to exhibit corresponding actions so that we can\r\nreally be the men and women of faith God expects us to be. Although James did not\r\nmean that a person is saved by good works; an individual can be declared righteous\r\nbefore God by his\/her doing and confession. According to Apostle Paul in his letter to\r\nthe Galatians, \"The only thing that counts is faith expressing itself through love.\" (Galatians 5:6b) Christians should note this and be ready to express genuine love\r\ntoward one another, as we relate with people of all races.<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> In what ways can we put our faith into action? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\r\n        <li> What are the things that can hinder us from exercising our faith? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\r\n        <li> What is the place of prayer in activating our faith? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 3-->\r\n        <\/ol>\r\n\r\n        <\/li>\r\n\r\n        <\/ol>\r\n   \r\n        <h4> Prayer Points <\/h4>\r\n        <ul>\r\n        <li> Pray and thank God for the power of His Word that is living and active.<\/li> <!-- Prayer Point 1-->\r\n        <li> Pray against every form of fear, doubt and unbelief that can hinder you from exercising your faith in God.<\/li> <!-- Prayer Point 2-->\r\n        <li> Ask God to give you the grace that will enable you to believe His Word and act obediently all the time.<\/li> <!-- Prayer Point 3-->\r\n        <\/ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n             <h4> Fellowship and Ministry Building Activities <\/h4>\r\n        <ul>\r\n        <li> Identify a needy person in your church, family or community and minister to their physical needs this week. <\/li> <!-- Fellowship Activity 1-->\r\n        <li> List five examples each of men\/women from both the Old and New Testaments who demonstrated living faith. <\/li> <!-- Fellowship Activity 2-->\r\n        <li> Pray together as class members for God to increase your faith.<\/li>\r\n        <\/ul>\r\n\r\n           <h4> Take Home <\/h4>\r\n        \r\n        <ul>\r\n        \r\n        <li> Faith without works is dead.

One day, she was beaten by her\r\nhusband to the point that she was\r\nadmitted to a hospital for several days.\r\nAfter being discharged, she resolved to\r\nseek the help of a herbalist to kill her\r\nhusband. Having narrated her ordeal,\r\nthe herbalist simply folded an empty sheet of paper and gave it to her saying, \"Whenever there is a quarrel between you and\r\nyour husband, put this paper in your mouth and press it with your teeth so that it will\r\nnot fall to the ground.\" The woman strictly adhered to the instruction never to talk\r\nback at her husband the next time there was a misunderstanding. While her husband\r\nwas surprised and became curious about the sudden change in his wife, the woman\r\nwas eagerly waiting to see her husband dead. However, after much investigation, it\r\nwas discovered that the herbalist did not do anything special, he only taught the\r\nwoman indirectly the importance of controlling her tongue whenever there was a\r\nquarrel.    <\/p>  <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n\r\n        <p>     Today's lesson focuses on a disciplined faith, especially in the use of our\r\ntongues. From experience, some people have found themselves in unnecessary\r\ntrouble because they could not control their tongues. Besides, mere words have wrecked\r\ncommunal living, marriages and family relationships, and so many people are in despair\r\ndue to some people\\'s inability to tame their tongues. As people who have professed faith\r\nin Christ Jesus, God expects us to demonstrate a high level of discipline regarding what\r\nwe say and teach. James said those who consider themselves religious and yet do not\r\nkeep a tight rein on their tongue deceive themselves and their religion is worthless\r\n(James 1:26). Although the tongue is about the smallest part of the body, we must\r\nunderstand how destructive it can be if not tamed.   <\/p>  <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n\r\n\r\n        <h4>THE LESSON EXPLAINED<\/h4>\r\n\r\n        <ol type=\"A\">\r\n\r\n        <li>\r\n\r\n        <h5>  Warning against Hasty Desires James 3:1-2 <\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\r\n\r\n        <p> The opening of this chapter suggests that there were some people in the days of James\r\nwho were eager to become teachers. This was so probably because in the Jewish\r\nsetting a teacher occupied an important position of authority and influence, just like\r\nthe scribes and rabbis. However, James made them know that not all of them should\r\nbecome teachers (v. 1) because those who teach will be judged more strictly. In like\r\nmanner, regarding the religious leaders who took advantage of people, Jesus said that\r\ntheir punishment will be severe (Mark 12:40). According to James, we all make\r\nmistakes but those who never make any mistake in the use of their tongue can be\r\nregarded as perfect and they possess the ability to control their whole body.\r\nNevertheless, we should not misunderstand James' counsel about becoming teachers\r\nof the Word of God. James wanted the would-be teachers to understand their\r\nresponsibilities, especially regarding the use of their tongues and words in their\r\nteaching ministry. Therefore, those who desire to be teachers, according to James,\r\nshould be able to control their tongues so that they can influence their class members\r\npositively. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n\r\n        <p> Teaching is so important that James did not exonerate himself. In verse 2 he\r\nsaid, \"We all stumble in many ways. If anyone is never at fault in what he says, he is a\r\nperfect man, able to keep his whole body in check.\" James wanted his audience to\r\nknow the power of the tongue as it has the ability to build and destroy. Therefore, as teachers of the Word of God, our lives should not be contrary to what we teach so that\r\nwe will not be guilty like the scribes, according to Jesus' evaluation in Matthew 23:1-7.\r\nTeachers of the Word who have discovered their giftedness in the area of teaching\r\nshould not be discouraged because of James\\' warning in this passage. Instead, they\r\nshould work hard so that what they teach will influence people positively and not\r\ncontradict their lifestyles. Therefore, if you are gifted in teaching adults, youths,\r\nteenagers or children, simply make your interest known to your pastor and ask the\r\nHoly Spirit to help you to be an exemplary teacher with a disciplined faith. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n\r\n\r\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> Why did James caution against being hasty to become a teacher? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\r\n        <li> What are the things that can help teachers not to be guilty of what they teach, according to the lesson? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\r\n        <\/ol>\r\n\r\n        <\/li>\r\n\r\n        <li>\r\n\r\n        <h5> The Power of the Tongue James 3:3-6 <\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\r\n\r\n        <p> As he continued his instruction about the importance of taming the tongue, especially\r\nas teachers of the Word, James gave a comprehensive description of the power of the\r\ntongue. He likened the tongue to small objects that are used to control big objects such\r\nas bits to control horses to make them obey and rudder to control ships to wherever the\r\npilots want them to go. (vv. 3-4) In like manner, the tongue, though small, can boast\r\nabout great things just as a large forest can be set on fire by a small spark. According to\r\nverse 6, the damage the tongue can cause is described in these terms:\r\n\r\n<\/p><ul>\r\n<li> It is a fire this means that it has the capability to consume and destroy lives. <\/li>\r\n<li> A world of evil. It can corrupt the whole person. The Scripture says that the\r\ntongue has the power of life and death (Proverbs 18:21). <\/li>\r\n<li> It can set the whole course of life on fire. <\/li>\r\n<li> It is itself set on fire by hell.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n  <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n\r\n        <p> The tongue has the power to destroy just like a small spark of fire can set a large\r\nforest ablaze. Experience has shown that many churches have been divided because\r\nof some people who lack the power to control their tongues. Little wonder James said\r\nthat the tongue with which we praise our Lord and Father is the same tongue with\r\nwhich we curse men, who have been made in God's likeness ... (vv 9-10). This of\r\ncourse is an indication that we are expected to use our tongues to praise, bless,\r\nencourage, edify, comfort, soothe and not to curse or destroy people. According to\r\nApostle Paul in his letter to the church in Colossae, our words should be full of grace,\r\nand seasoned with salt (Colossians 4:6). He further said, \"Do not let any unwholesome talk [word] come out of your mouths, but only what is helpful for building others up\r\naccording to their needs, that it may benefit those who listen\" (Ephesians 4:29).\r\nBelievers should be careful about what they say. Before you speak, be conscious that\r\nwords are like fire; you can neither control nor reverse the damage they have done,\r\nonce spoken. The tongue has the ability to either build or tear down.<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n\r\n\r\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> Mention the sins people commit that do not involve the use of the tongue. <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\r\n        <li> \"... and with it we curse men, who have been made in God's likeness.\" verse 39b.\r\nDiscuss. <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\r\n        <li> Discuss some steps believers can take to control the way they use their tongues. <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 3-->\r\n        <\/ol>\r\n\r\n        <\/li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        <li>\r\n\r\n        <h5> Taming the Tongue James 3:7-12  <\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\r\n\r\n        <p> The ability of a man to tame his tongue is definitely a sign of a disciplined faith. James\r\nemphasised that all kinds of animals are being tamed and have been tamed by\r\nhumankind but sadly, no one can tame the tongue. He, therefore, referred to it as a\r\nrestless evil and full of deadly poison that can cause great damage to the entire body\r\n(vv. 7-8). He said that from the same mouth comes praise and curse, an attitude\r\ncontrary to the will of God.

His ministry was\r\nidentified with signs and wonders. At\r\nevery crusade, many people would come\r\nfrom far and near not only to listen to his\r\npolished messages but to receive their\r\nown miracles. At intervals, some people\r\nwould come out to testify of their healing\r\nmiracles and by this, Baba miracle\r\ngained more popularity with many\r\nfaithful disciples who were dedicated to\r\nhis ministry. One day, it was discovered that those who gave testimonies of healing were actually paid to do so in order for\r\nBaba miracle to gain popularity and make more money. Within a very short while, the\r\nministry ceased to exist because people discovered that it was fake.   <\/p>  <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n\r\n        <p>    However, the story in today's passage is quite different from the fake healing\r\nmiracles associated with Baba miracle's ministry. The lesson centres on the faithful\r\ndisciples at Joppa. After the death of Tabitha, also known as Dorcas, these elders had\r\nfaith in God and believed that He could restore her back to life. Their faith was\r\ndemonstrated when Peter, who was invited as an apostle of God, prayed and she was\r\nrestored to life. The miracle of the restoration of life became known all over Joppa\r\nand many came to believe in God. In fact, the faith of these elders should challenge us\r\ntoday to believe in the God of all genuine miracles.    <\/p>  <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n\r\n        \r\n        <h4>THE LESSON EXPLAINED<\/h4>\r\n\r\n        <ol type=\"A\">\r\n\r\n        <li>\r\n        \r\n        <h5> A Generous and Faithful Disciple\r\nAct 9:36-38 <\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> As a missionary, Peter travelled to various places to visit God\\'s people including\r\nLydda, where he miraculously healed a paralysed man that made many in the city turn\r\nto the Lord (vv. 32-35). While he was at Lydda, there was a woman in Joppa named\r\nTabitha, (which when translated in Greek is Dorcas, meaning \"a deer\"). According to\r\nthe passage, she was a disciple, woman of faith and a faithful follower of Christ who\r\nwas always doing good and helping the poor. At that time, she became ill and died,\r\nand her body was washed according to the Jewish custom of purification of the dead\r\nand laid in an upstairs room. Interestingly, the disciples demonstrated their faith in\r\n__\r\nGod when they heard that Peter was in Lydda, they sent two men to him saying,\r\n\"Please come at once!\" (v. 38). <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> There is no doubt that Tabitha was a generous woman, a good steward of God\\'s\r\nresources. From the phrase 'always doing good', we can deduce that she used every\r\nopportunity she had to bless lives. She truly loved the Lord and other brethren not\r\nonly in words but also in deed (1 John 3:17-18). Therefore, we can say that this\r\nwoman of faith (Tabitha) fulfilled God's expectations for which she was created\r\naccording to Ephesians 2:10. \u201cFor we are God's workmanship, created in Christ\r\nJesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do.\u201d Her life was an\r\nembodiment of generosity, which stresses the importance of a living faith. As\r\nChristians who know the importance of generosity, we should heed the counsel of\r\nPaul who said, \"... let us do good to all people, especially to those who belong to the\r\nfamily of believers.\" (Galatians 6:10) By so doing, we shall prove that we are truly\r\nfaithful disciples of Jesus. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> Is it practicable today to lend helping hands to as many people who solicit our\r\nhelp? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\r\n        <li> How often should we help a particular needy person who seems to be lazy? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\r\n        \r\n        <\/ol>\r\n\r\n        <\/li>\r\n\r\n <li>\r\n        \r\n        <h5> The Miracle of Resurrection\r\nActs 9:39-43 <\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> Peter's response to the call of the faithful disciples is astonishing.

He\r\ngraduated from one of the popular\r\nNigerian universities with a brilliant\r\nresult. After his National Youth Service\r\nCorps, he sensed God calling him into\r\nfull-time ministry. Consequently,\r\nbecause of his passion and desire to\r\nsucceed as a pastor, he sought the help of\r\none of the most respected senior pastors\r\nin his Association to be his mentor.\r\nHaving been trained as a Baptist pastor, he continued in his relationship with his mentor who was devoted to helping him\r\nsucceed in the ministry, especially after he had been called by a church. From time to\r\ntime, the senior pastor encouraged and admonished him when necessary and\r\nsometimes, shared practical examples of how to become successful in the ministry. He\r\nwas particularly warned against the love for money, women and power. To the glory of\r\nGod, after serving the church for a period of ten years, he was appreciated by his\r\nchurch as one of the most disciplined pastors in the Association. Interestingly, the\r\nyoung pastor publicly gave the credit to the senior pastor who had mentored him from\r\nthe beginning.     <\/p>  <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n\r\n        <p>    The relationship between the young pastor and his mentor is similar to that of\r\nTimothy and Paul. Timothy was a young Christian from Asia Minor. He had a Jewish\r\nmother and a Greek father (Acts 16:1). He became a companion and an assistant to\r\nPaul, who mentored him. Paul did not leave young Timothy to struggle on his own in\r\nthe ministry; he mentored him and constantly gave him instructions about church\r\nadministration and worship with a description of the kind of character that church\r\nleaders should possess. Today's lesson focuses on Paul's final instruction to young\r\nTimothy, his son in the Lord, to fight the good fight of faith as a good servant of Jesus\r\nChrist. However, Paul's instructions to Timothy are also relevant to believers today,\r\nespecially as we continue to fight the good fight of faith.    <\/p>  <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n\r\n        \r\n        <h4>THE LESSON EXPLAINED<\/h4>\r\n\r\n        <ol type=\"A\">\r\n\r\n        <li>\r\n        \r\n        <h5> The Command to Fight the Good Fight 1 Timothy 6:11-16 <\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> Paul's labour over his spiritual son, Timothy, was all-inclusive. Previously, Paul had\r\nwarned and instructed Timothy to run away from false doctrines, quarrels,\r\ncontroversies, the love of money, envy and malicious talks for fear of wandering away\r\nfrom the faith (vv. 3-10). Thereafter, he admonished him to pursue godly virtues like\r\nrighteousness, godliness, faith, love, endurance and gentleness (v. 11). In fact, the\r\ncharge to pursue means to put in his best to possess these qualities. Furthermore, he\r\nwas instructed to do his best in the race of faith and attain the eternal life to which he\r\nwas called when he first confessed Jesus in the presence of many witnesses. Without\r\ndoubt, Paul's desire was that Timothy should hold fast to his faith and keep the\r\ncommands faithfully until the day our Lord Jesus will appear (v. 14). <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> As Christians, we are called and charged to defend the truth of the Gospel and\r\nfight against those things that contend with our faith. As we fight the good fight of\r\nfaith, we must keep the faith by knowing Christ personally and making Him known,\r\nobeying Him and doing what we know is right, keeping His commandment until the\r\nbaton of faith is passed on to the next generation, and living day by day without spot or\r\nblemish until Christ appears. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> In view of the present reality, how easy is it for Christians to pursue righteousness,\r\nwhether as students, government officials, business men\/women, artisans, etc.? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\r\n        <li> Discuss \u201cProsperity Gospel\u201d in the light of Paul's warning to Timothy. <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\r\n       \r\n        <\/ol>\r\n\r\n        <\/li>\r\n\r\n <li>\r\n        \r\n        <h5> Command to the Rich\r\n1 Timothy 6:17-21 <\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> As a young man in the ministry, Paul did not relent in his effort to instruct Timothy in\r\nthe way he should go.

Specifically, he was commanded to\r\nguide the rich so that they will not:\r\n      <\/p><ul>\r\n      <li> Be arrogant.

More importantly, Timothy\r\nwas to guard what has been entrusted to his care, which some have interpreted to be\r\nChristian truth (2 Timothy 2:2). Finally, Paul admonished Timothy to turn away from\r\ngodless chatter and opposing ideas, falsely called knowledge. The admonition\r\nbecame necessary because of those who had wandered from the faith. Experience has\r\nshown that arrogance is a common tendency among the rich, but those who have truly\r\naccepted Jesus as their Saviour and Lord and whose hearts have been circumcised\r\nshould use their riches for good deeds so that they can store up eternal treasures for\r\nthemselves (v. 19). We must be generous by sharing our resources with those who are\r\nin need. The rich must not put their hope and trust in their money but in the living God.\r\nNo matter how poor we are, we must have something to share with someone. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> Why do you think these instructions were necessary for Timothy? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\r\n        <li> Mention some of the false teachings that are prevalent in our time and how to\r\novercome them. <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\r\n        <li> What does it mean to be rich in the sight of God? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 3-->\r\n        <\/ol>\r\n\r\n        <\/li>\r\n        <\/ol>\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h4> Prayer Points <\/h4>\r\n        <ul>\r\n        <li> Lord, help me to finish strong in this journey of faith. <\/li> <!-- Prayer Point 1-->\r\n        <li> Ask the Lord to give you grace so that you will not be consumed by the love of\r\nmoney in this end time. <\/li> <!-- Prayer Point 2-->\r\n        <li> Pray against every spirit of arrogance and pride because it destroys. <\/li> <!-- Prayer Point 3-->\r\n        <\/ul>\r\n\r\n             <h4> Fellowship and Ministry Building Activities <\/h4>\r\n        <ul>\r\n        <li> Let class members brainstorm on some of the reasons why some rich people\r\nare arrogant and how a believer can be free from this tendency <\/li> <!-- Fellowship Activity 1-->\r\n      \r\n        <\/ul>\r\n\r\n           <h4> Take Home <\/h4>\r\n        \r\n        <ul>\r\n        \r\n        <li> Be always ready to contend for your faith. <\/li> <!-- Take Home 1-->\r\n        <li> Do not place too much value on earthly riches. <\/li> <!-- Take Home 2-->\r\n        <li> Christians should strive to live godly lives at all times. <\/li> <!-- Take Home 2-->\r\n        <li> Do not put your trust in your riches. <\/li> <!-- Take Home 2-->\r\n        <\/ul><\/p>"},{"id":"9","title":"A TEST OF TRUTH ","message":"<p><center>\r\n\r\n            <h4> March 4, 2018 <\/h4> <!--DATE-->\r\n            <h3> A TEST OF TRUTH <\/h3> <!--TOPIC-->\r\n\r\n        <p>\r\n        <p> Devotional Reading: Psalm 20 <\/p> <!--Devotional Reading Passage-->\r\n        <p> Background Scripture: Genesis 22 <\/p> <!-- Background Scipture Passage-->\r\n        <p> Lesson Scripture: Genesis 22:1-2, 6-14 <\/p> <!-- Lesson Scipture Passage-->\r\n        <\/p>\r\n\r\n        <h4>Golden Text<\/h4>\r\n\r\n        <p> Abraham answered, \"God himself will provide the lamb for the\r\nburnt offering, my son.\" And the two of them went on together.\r\n<b>Genesis 22:8<\/b> <\/p> <!-- Golden Text; Make Sure the scripture passage is made bold-->\r\n\r\n<\/center>\r\n\r\n        <h4>Objectives :<\/h4>\r\n        <p>By the end of the lesson, class members should be able to:<\/p>\r\n\r\n        <ul>\r\n        <li> Discuss why God tested Abraham by\r\nasking him to sacrifice his son, Isaac. <\/li>   <!-- Objective 1-->\r\n        <li> Identify the source of Abraham\\'s\r\nmotivation to really sacrifice his son. <\/li>   <!-- Objective 2-->\r\n        <li> Discuss the importance of total\r\nobedience to God and His command\r\nin respect of today's lesson. <\/li>   <!-- Objective 3-->\r\n        <\/ul>\r\n\r\n        <h4>INTRODUCTION<\/h4>\r\n        <p>   A story was once told of a pastor\r\nwho was privileged to pastor\r\none of the biggest churches in his\r\nConference. He was very comfortable and\r\nwell loved by his members. But all of a\r\nsudden he resigned and decided to relocate\r\nto a lepers\u2019 colony in one of the towns in the\r\nSouth West, as a pastor. Despite all efforts\r\nby his wife, children, friends, family and\r\nchurch members to dissuade him from\r\nmaking such a risky decision, he remained\r\nadamant, even though he knew the\r\nconsequences of his decision. When some concerned members of the church asked him the reason for his decision, he simply\r\nsaid, \"God has spoken, his servant must obey.\" His slogan was, \"If Christ loves sinners, we\r\nshould also love others irrespective of their status.\" Ultimately, people testified to his\r\nfaithful and sincere service to the lepers in the colony for some years. Invariably, we can say\r\nthat the pastor passed the test of truth even though he died as a leper.   <\/p>  <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n\r\n        <p>    Sometimes, God tests His people to ascertain their commitment and level of\r\nobedience to Him, like the case of Abraham. Our lesson today is about how God\r\ntested the faith of Abraham by asking him to sacrifice his beloved son in order to\r\ndetermine his level of obedience to Him. Abraham, on his part, passed the test. He did\r\n__\r\nnot mind the bond between him and his son, Isaac the promised seed. Little wonder\r\nhe became the father of faith.    <\/p>  <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n\r\n        \r\n        <h4>THE LESSON EXPLAINED<\/h4>\r\n\r\n        <ol type=\"A\">\r\n\r\n        <li>\r\n        \r\n        <h5> Abraham's Supreme Test\r\nGenesis 22:1-2 <\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> The relationship between God and Abraham had been cordial since he was called to\r\nleave his father's land for the land He (God) would show him. The command was with\r\na promise to make him into a great nation, to bless and give him the Promised Land\r\n(Genesis 12:1-7). The promise was eventually fulfilled in chapter 21 when Isaac was\r\nborn to Abraham in his old age. However, God later tested his loyalty to Him. He\r\nsaid, \"Take your son, your only son, Isaac, whom you love, and go to the region of\r\nMoriah. Sacrifice him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains I will tell you\r\nabout.\" (v. 2) The expression \"... your only son, Isaac, whom you love, ...\" connotes a\r\nsense of the uniqueness of the child, Isaac, who was born out of promise. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> God's instruction to Abraham was clear and distinct. The object of the sacrifice\r\nwas Isaac, not Ishmael or any of his servants. Truly, Abraham's experience was a\r\nserious test because God had promised that his descendants would come through\r\nIsaac (Genesis 21:12b). Interestingly, his response was amazing as he was ready to\r\ncarry out the task without hesitation (vv. 3-8). Abraham did not question God, or\r\nsuggest an alternative, which reveals the depth of his faith and total loyalty to God.\r\nImmediately he received the message, he set out to do just what God instructed him to\r\ndo. We can, therefore, say that God still tests His people to determine the extent of\r\ntheir love and faith in Him. Those who faithfully undergo such tests are greatly\r\nrewarded and will serve as examples to other believers, like Abraham. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> Discuss some of the ways God tests His people today and how to pass such tests. <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\r\n        <li> What are the likely consequences of disobeying God's commands?

According to verse 6, he believed God and it was\r\ncredited to him as righteousness. His assignment of sacrificing his only beloved son,\r\nIsaac, was a difficult one but as a man of faith, he embarked on the journey without\r\nhesitation. While he made Isaac to carry the wood, he himself carried the other\r\nelements for the burnt offering. As they walked towards the mountain, Isaac became\r\ncurious and asked his father \u201c... where is the lamb for the burnt offering? (v. 7b)\r\nAbraham's mature response revealed the depth of his trust and faith in God. He said, 'God himself will provide the lamb for the burnt offering ....' The climax of the\r\nexperience was that having built an altar, Abraham bound Isaac, laid him on it and\r\nreached out for a knife and wanted to kill him but God spoke through an angel who halted\r\nthe action saying to him, \"Do not lay a hand on the boy,\"... \"Do not do anything to him ...\" (v.\r\n12). Of course, God was pleased and testified of Abraham's unreserved loyalty to Him. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> Certainly, the journey of Abraham and his son, Isaac, was faith-based.\r\nAccording to his confession in verse 8, God truly provided an alternative (a lamb) for\r\nthe burnt offering instead of Isaac. At last, Abraham obtained an attestation from\r\nheaven of the genuineness of his faith with a revelation of God's ability to always meet\r\nour needs. Therefore, his faith was made complete by what he did __ he obeyed God\r\nwithout hesitating. James cited the action of Abraham to prove that faith is shown by\r\nmeans of appropriate actions (James 2:21). Consequently, God can always meet our\r\nneeds in ways that are quite unusual when we trust and obey His instructions.\r\nTherefore, believers should be willing to demonstrate their faith in God, no matter\r\nhow difficult it may seem. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> What do you think would be the attitude of Isaac to his father after the whole\r\nepisode? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\r\n        <li> Discuss some of the ways Christians can demonstrate their total obedience to God\r\nwithout counting the cost. <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\r\n       \r\n        <\/ol>\r\n\r\n        <\/li>\r\n        \r\n          <li>\r\n        \r\n        <h5> God's Divine Provision\r\nGenesis 22:13-14 <\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> Our God specialises in making provisions for His people beyond their\r\ncomprehension. Having been instructed by God not to harm Isaac, because of the\r\ndemonstration of his faith, God provided a substitute. When Abraham looked up, he\r\nsaw a ram caught by its horns, which eventually served as an object for the burnt\r\noffering instead of his son, Isaac. Certainly, Abraham was astonished by the divine\r\nprovision thus he called the place 'The LORD Will Provide' and to this day, people still\r\nsay, \"On the mountain of the Lord, it will be provided.\" So, the ram was sacrificed in place of Isaac just like Jesus Christ who gave His life as a ransom for the remission of\r\nthe sins of humankind (Mark 10:45). Our God does not undermine our sacrificial\r\nservices to Him. Whenever we attempt great things for Him without reservation, we\r\ncan be sure that we will be greatly rewarded. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n        \r\n          <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> Throughout the passage, nothing is said about Sarah.

Our lesson today centres on the fulfilment of God's promises\r\nto David and Israel, by extension, as witnessed by Solomon. After the building and\r\nfurnishing of the temple was completed and the ark of the Lord was brought in,\r\nSolomon dedicated the temple to the Lord. He prayed and appreciated God for keeping\r\nthe promise He made to his father, David.   <\/p>  <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n\r\n        \r\n        <h4>THE LESSON EXPLAINED<\/h4>\r\n\r\n        <ol type=\"A\">\r\n\r\n        <li>\r\n        \r\n        <h5> Solomon Worshipped God for Promises Fulfilled 2 Chronicles 6:12-15 <\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> Solomon began to build the temple of the Lord in Jerusalem on Mount Moriah, where\r\nthe Lord had appeared to his father David. He also furnished it greatly (chapters 3, 4).\r\nFrom verse 1 of the chapter, he expressed gratitude to God for fulfilling His promises.\r\nHe prayed and praised God before the whole assembly for keeping His covenant of\r\nlove with His servants who continued whole-heartedly in His ways. He also praised\r\nGod for keeping and fulfilling His promise to David, his father (v. 15). In an\r\natmosphere of worship, Solomon did the following:\r\n        <\/p><ul>\r\n        <li> He stood on a brazen scaffold, which was made for that purpose, so that everyone\r\ncould see and hear him. <\/li>\r\n        <li> He knelt down before God on the platform in total submission and humble\r\nadoration, in the presence of the congregation. <\/li>\r\n        <li> He knelt down before God on the platform in total submission and humble\r\nadoration, in the presence of the congregation. <\/li>\r\n        <li> He described God as One without equal who keeps His covenant with those who\r\nwalk blamelessly before Him. <\/li>\r\n        <\/ul>\r\n      \r\n <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> One attribute that distinguishes God from humankind is that He is always faithful to\r\nHis promises (2 Peter 3:3). David\\'s initial plan to build a magnificent temple for the\r\nLord was against the will of God; rather, his offspring would build the temple (2\r\nSamuel 7:13). The completion of the temple necessitated the praise and prayer before\r\nthe whole assembly for the fulfilment of God's promise to David. This implies that the\r\npromises of God are often connected with the faithfulness of His people. The most\r\nimportant lesson from this passage is that God is always faithful to His promises.\r\nTherefore, whenever God fulfils His promises concerning us, we should learn to show\r\nappreciation to Him in songs, prayers and meditation.&nbsp; <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> How can we relay the testimonies of God's blessings and the fulfilment of His\r\npromises to our children so that the culture of gratitude can be transferred? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\r\n        <li> Discuss some consequences of not fulfilling one's promises. <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\r\n       \r\n        <\/ol>\r\n\r\n        <\/li>\r\n\r\n <li>\r\n        \r\n        <h5> Solomon's Sincere Petition\r\n2 Chronicles 6:16-21 <\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> Solomon continued in his prayer with petitions as he appealed to God to keep the\r\npromise He made to his father, David. His request was that God should continually\r\nraise offspring to succeed David and to establish his kingdom forever (2 Samuel\r\n7:12; 2 Chronicles 6:16-17). He also affirmed that God does not live on earth\r\namong men neither does the heaven and the highest heavens contain Him much less\r\nthe temple, which he has built (v. 18). In his letter to King Hiram of Tyre, Solomon\r\nalso expressed this same praise to God (2 Chronicles 2:6). He passionately\r\nappealed to God to:\r\n       <\/p><ul>\r\n       <li> Give attention to his prayer and appeal for the sake of His mercy <\/li>\r\n       <li> Make His eyes (presence) to be on the temple day and night where He had\r\npromised to put His Name.<\/li>\r\n       <li> Answer the prayers of His people, which they pray toward the temple. <\/li>\r\n       <li> Hear the prayer of His people, Israel, from heaven and forgive their sins. <\/li>\r\n       <\/ul>\r\n      <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> Solomon was sincere in his prayer with the assurance that God will answer the\r\nrequests and supplications of His people, which they make in the temple. It is\r\nimportant to note that the first request made by Solomon is the preservation of the\r\nthrone, the prosperity of his people and that of the royal lineage. This is important\r\nbecause the royal palace plays an important role in the religious life of the people.\r\nMore so, He requested for God's continual presence and attendance to the people's\r\nsupplications. It is worth mentioning that Solomon's style of prayer is quite\r\nremarkable unlike some believers' style today whose prayers are self-centred and\r\nself-seeking. Solomon demonstrated humility and passionately pleaded with God\r\nto hear their prayers based on His mercy. Solomon repeatedly reminded God of His\r\npromise to his father, David, to establish his throne forever. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> What was the significance of the temple to the people of Israel? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\r\n        <li> Analyse the prayer of Solomon and discuss where it differs from the type of prayer\r\nsome believers pray today. <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\r\n        \r\n        <\/ol>\r\n\r\n        <\/li>\r\n\r\n        <\/ol>\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h4> Prayer Points <\/h4>\r\n        <ul>\r\n        <li> Help me, O Lord, to always keep my promise of walking in Your will and ways. <\/li> <!-- Prayer Point 1-->\r\n        <li> Give me a grateful heart to recognise and celebrate Your fulfilled promise. <\/li> <!-- Prayer Point 2-->\r\n        <li> May Your promises for me and my family come to pass, in Jesus' Name. <\/li> <!-- Prayer Point 3-->\r\n        <\/ul>\r\n\r\n             <h4> Fellowship and Ministry Building Activities <\/h4>\r\n        <ul>\r\n        <li> Let class members mention some attributes of Solomon they wish to emulate. <\/li> <!-- Fellowship Activity 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <\/ul>\r\n\r\n           <h4> Take Home <\/h4>\r\n        \r\n        <ul>\r\n        \r\n        <li> God is ever faithful to His promises <\/li> <!-- Take Home 1-->\r\n        <li> Christians should learn to keep their promises, whether to God or humankind. <\/li> <!-- Take Home 2-->\r\n        <li> Whenever we pray from a sincere heart, He hears us. <\/li> <!-- Take Home 2-->\r\n        <li> God does not dwell in houses made by humankind. <\/li> <!-- Take Home 2-->\r\n        <\/ul><\/p>"},{"id":"11","title":"THE PEOPLE GAVE THANKS TO GOD","message":"<p><center>\r\n\r\n            <h4> March 18, 2018 <\/h4> <!--DATE-->\r\n            <h3> THE PEOPLE GAVE THANKS TO GOD <\/h3> <!--TOPIC-->\r\n\r\n        <p>\r\n        <p> Devotional Reading: Psalm 138 <\/p> <!--Devotional Reading Passage-->\r\n        <p> Background Scripture: 2 Chronicles 7:1-11 <\/p> <!-- Background Scipture Passage-->\r\n        <p> Lesson Scripture: 2 Chronicles 7:1-9 <\/p> <!-- Lesson Scipture Passage-->\r\n        <\/p>\r\n\r\n        <h4>Golden Text<\/h4>\r\n\r\n        <p> When all the Israelites saw the fire coming down and the glory of the LORD above\r\nthe temple, they knelt on the pavement with their faces to the ground, and they\r\nworshipped and gave thanks to the LORD, saying, \"He is good; his love endures\r\nforever.\" <b>2 Chronicles 7:3<\/b> <\/p> <!-- Golden Text; Make Sure the scripture passage is made bold-->\r\n\r\n<\/center>\r\n\r\n        <h4>Objectives :<\/h4>\r\n        <p>By the end of the lesson, class members should be able to:<\/p>\r\n\r\n        <ul>\r\n        <li> Identify various ways God reveals Himself to His people. <\/li>   <!-- Objective 1-->\r\n        <li> Discuss how Christians can show gratitude to God for the manifestation of His power. <\/li>   <!-- Objective 2-->\r\n        <li> Recognise divine landmarks and celebrate God's faithfulness. <\/li>   <!-- Objective 3-->\r\n        <\/ul>\r\n\r\n        <h4>INTRODUCTION<\/h4>\r\n        <p>    Recently, God's Grace Baptist\r\nChurch, Uguma, made history. It\r\nwas a week of commemoration\r\nfor the members having successfully\r\ncompleted the reconstruction of the\r\nchurch auditorium, which was burnt\r\ndown when members of the Boko Haram\r\nsect attacked the community. The week\r\nwas marked by different activities like\r\nBible study, quiz and games, marriage\r\nseminar, testimonies, stewardship\r\nlectures, etc. The climax of the\r\ncelebration was the appreciation service for the pasor for his resilience and hard work over the years. The entire members of\r\nthe church and other invited guests were excited as they sang praises to God, danced,\r\nprayed and finally gave thanks to God for His provision and faithfulness.    <\/p>  <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n\r\n        <p> Usually, people rejoice and are filled with gratitude to God when a promise is\r\nfulfilled, especially when they have directly benefitted from such a promise. Such\r\nwas the case of Solomon and the people of Israel who gathered together to dedicate\r\nthe temple built in honour of God; and offered sacrifices to Him. It was seven days of\r\nfestivity; on the eight day, there was a solemn meeting before they all dispersed. The\r\nceremony was a spiritual landmark in the history of the people of Israel. Particularly,\r\nGod agreed to honour all of Solomon's request but with the condition that the people\r\nmust demonstrate complete obedience in their relationship with Him.  <\/p>  <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n\r\n        \r\n        <h4>THE LESSON EXPLAINED<\/h4>\r\n\r\n        <ol type=\"A\">\r\n\r\n        <li>\r\n        \r\n        <h5> God's Glorious Manifestation\r\n2 Chronicles 7:1-3 <\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> Solomon's prayer was a long one (6:14-42). Precisely in verse 42, he made an appeal\r\nto God to remember the love He promised His servant David. The aftermath of his\r\nprayer was the glorious manifestation of God's presence when fire came down from\r\nheaven and consumed the burnt offerings and the sacrifices. Consequently, the\r\ntemple was filled with the glory of the Lord and the priests were prevented from\r\nentering into the temple. Of course, it was evidence that Solomon's prayers had been\r\nanswered. Ultimately, the people of Israel were amazed as they witnessed the coming\r\ndown of fire and the glory of God above the temple. Their response was awesome.\r\nThey fell down on the pavement and worshipped God saying, \"He is good; his love\r\nendures forever\" (v. 3). In like manner, fire came out from the presence of God and\r\nconsumed Aaron's sacrifices at the Tent of Meeting and all the people shouted for joy\r\nand bowed down in worship (Leviticus 9:23-24). <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> God responds to His people in different ways. For instance, He revealed\r\nHimself to Moses through the burning bush (Genesis 3:3-6) and to Saul through a\r\nlight from heaven (Acts 9:3-5). But in this passage, the manifestation of God's glory\r\nin the temple reveals that:\r\n         <\/p><ul>\r\n         <li> God is glorious; for He is a consuming fire. <\/li>\r\n         <li> God is gracious to Israel. <\/li>\r\n         <li> Their prayers had been answered. <\/li>\r\n         <\/ul>\r\n            <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n        \r\n         <p> The people also responded accordingly to the manifestation of God's\r\npresence as they worshipped and praised Him with sincere hearts (v. 3). They\r\nbowed their faces to the groun,d acknowledged God's mercy and worshipped with\r\ncheerful submission to the divine authority. This attitude should remind us of the\r\nneed to constantly remember that God is good; therefore, we should always offer\r\nHim thanksgiving, especially when He chooses to manifest His power and glory in\r\nour midst. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 3-->\r\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> Let class members discuss various ways they have experienced the manifestation\r\nof God's power in the last three months and how it has affected their relationship\r\nwith Him <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\r\n        <li> Discuss some other ways Christians can show gratitude to God for the\r\nmanifestation of His power on daily basis. <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\r\n        <li> Discuss ways class members can be thankful to God <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 3-->\r\n        <\/ol>\r\n\r\n        <\/li>\r\n\r\n <li>\r\n        \r\n        <h5> The Temple Dedication\r\n2 Chronicles 7:4-9 <\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> The response of the people to the glorious manifestation of God was so overwhelming that\r\nSolomon offered sacrifices of twenty-two thousand head of cattle and a hundred and twenty\r\nthousand sheep and goats to the Lord. The temple was dedicated. The priests and Levites\r\nplayed active parts in the dedication service with the Lord's musical instruments, which\r\nDavid had made. They blew their trumpets, praised the Lord and gave thanks saying, \"His\r\nlove endures forever\" (v. 6). Having consecrated the middle part of the temple, Solomon\r\noffered sacrifices of fellowship offerings. The festival which attracted a great number of\r\npeople from Lebo Hamath to the Wadi of Egypt lasted seven days. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> To dedicate something is the same as to devote or set it aside for the purpose of God.\r\nTherefore, it is clear from the passage that Solomon and the people of Israel understood the\r\nconcept and duly demonstrated complete obedience to God in the construction and\r\ndedication of the temple. Little wonder God's presence and power was made manifest and\r\nthe people responded in praise and thanksgiving to God. Christians often dedicate their\r\npossessions like cars, houses, children and other material possessions to God without\r\nactually releasing such things for the use of God. Based on today's lesson, Christians should\r\ncultivate the habit of dedicating their possessions for God's use considering the fact that He\r\nis the owner of everything while we are the caretakers. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> Discuss the significance of the seven days which the festival lasted. <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\r\n        <li> What was the reason for the consecration of the temple by Solomon? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\r\n       \r\n        <\/ol>\r\n\r\n        <\/li>\r\n        <\/ol>\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h4> Prayer Points <\/h4>\r\n        <ul>\r\n        <li> O Lord our God, give me a thankful heart that I may recognise and appreciate You appropriately for Your uncountable blessings. <\/li> <!-- Prayer Point 1-->\r\n        <li> Lord, reveal Your glory to Your people again <\/li> <!-- Prayer Point 2-->\r\n        <li> Teach me, Lord, to always sing songs of thanksgiving, no matter the challenges\r\nof life <\/li> <!-- Prayer Point 3-->\r\n        <\/ul>\r\n\r\n             <h4> Fellowship and Ministry Building Activities <\/h4>\r\n        <ul>\r\n        <li> Compare and contrast the worship in this passage with the worship in churches\r\ntoday. <\/li> <!-- Fellowship Activity 1-->\r\n        <li> List the different ways we can learn to worship God with our whole hearts and\r\ncontinue to pray for grace to improve <\/li> <!-- Fellowship Activity 2-->\r\n        <\/ul>\r\n\r\n           <h4> Take Home <\/h4>\r\n        \r\n        <ul>\r\n        \r\n        <li> Christians should recognise the fact that God deserves our praise and worship <\/li> <!-- Take Home 1-->\r\n        <li> Believers should set aside time for regular communal worship like the people of\r\nIsrael. <\/li> <!-- Take Home 2-->\r\n        <li> Following God's instructions can be rewarding. <\/li> <!-- Take Home 2-->\r\n        <li> We should cultivate the habit of dedicating our possessions and lives to God. <\/li> <!-- Take Home 2-->\r\n        <\/ul><\/p>"},{"id":"12","title":"KEEP MY STATUTES AND ORDINANCES","message":"<p><center>\r\n\r\n            <h4> March 25, 2018 <\/h4> <!--DATE-->\r\n            <h3> KEEP MY STATUTES AND ORDINANCES <\/h3> <!--TOPIC-->\r\n\r\n        <p>\r\n        <p> Devotional Reading: Isaiah 58:6-12 <\/p> <!--Devotional Reading Passage-->\r\n        <p> Background Scripture \/ Lesson Scripture: 2 Chronicles 7:12-22 <\/p> <!-- Background Scipture Passage-->\r\n       \r\n        <\/p>\r\n\r\n        <h4>Golden Text<\/h4>\r\n\r\n        <p> If my people, who are called by my name, will humble themselves and pray and\r\nseek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then will I hear from heaven and will\r\nforgive their sin and will heal their land.\r\n<b>2 Chronicles 7:14<\/b> <\/p> <!-- Golden Text; Make Sure the scripture passage is made bold-->\r\n\r\n<\/center>\r\n\r\n        <h4>Objectives :<\/h4>\r\n        <p>By the end of the lesson, class members should be able to:<\/p>\r\n\r\n        <ul>\r\n        <li> Discuss how disobedience to God\r\ncan result in divine punishment. <\/li>   <!-- Objective 1-->\r\n        <li> State some reasons why people find\r\nit difficult to abide by rules\r\nestablished by those in positions of\r\nauthority. <\/li>   <!-- Objective 2-->\r\n        <li> Discuss the benefits of total\r\nobedience to God in relation to the\r\nlesson. <\/li>   <!-- Objective 3-->\r\n        <\/ul>\r\n\r\n        <h4>INTRODUCTION<\/h4>\r\n        <p>   Mr Akpan John graduated from\r\none of the universities in\r\nNigeria with a first class.

Furthermore, it was\r\nan opportunity for the people to celebrate the Festival of Shelters for seven days in\r\nremembrance of God's blessings. The lesson of today is a reminder that God's blessing\r\nupon His people Israel was with a condition their willingness to keep His statues and\r\nordinances and to serve Him faithfully.   <\/p>  <!-- Paragraph 3-->\r\n         \r\n         \r\n        <h4>THE LESSON EXPLAINED<\/h4>\r\n\r\n        <ol type=\"A\">\r\n\r\n        <li>\r\n        \r\n        <h5> God Appears to Solomon\r\n2 Chronicles 7:12-16 <\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> After Solomon had finished the construction of the Lord's Temple, the palace and all\r\nhe had planned to do, the Lord appeared to him at night. This is the second time God\r\nappeared to Solomon. The first was when he prayed for wisdom (2 Chronicles 1:1-13).\r\nGod said to him, \"I have heard your prayer and have chosen this place for myself as a\r\ntemple for sacrifice.\" (v. 12) God told Solomon that even though He shuts the heaven\r\nso that there is no rain, or commands the locusts to devour or sends a pestilence to the\r\nland, there is hope for His people. However, it was with a condition that the people\r\nmust humble themselves before Him, pray, seek His face and turn from their wicked\r\nways (v. 14). In addition, God promised to watch over the Temple and answer their\r\nprayers. The reason is that the Temple had been specially chosen and consecrated as a\r\ndesignated place for His worship. Therefore, He will protect it forever (v. 16). God's\r\nanswer in these verses matches the characteristics of Solomon's earlier prayer of\r\ndedication that God would consecrate the Temple, receive the people's worship, and\r\npreserve Israel from calamity. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> By implication, just as disobedience to God brings about punishment; so total\r\nobedience leads to prosperity, deliverance and various blessings. God's repeated\r\nappearance to Solomon suggests that believers need fresh manifestations of God. It\r\nshould also be noted that the willingness of the people to confess their wickedness and\r\nforsake them was a condition for receiving God's forgiveness. This further portrays\r\nthe fact that the prayer of a sinner is an abomination to God but when we walk humbly\r\nwith Him, He hears and blesses us. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> Does God forgive sins without confession? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\r\n        <li> Discuss what would have become of the people of Israel and their leaders if they\r\nhad not confessed their sins. <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\r\n       \r\n        <\/ol>\r\n\r\n        <\/li>\r\n\r\n <li>\r\n        \r\n        <h5> A Call to Total Obedience\r\n2 Chronicles 7:17-22  <\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> God does not change His standard, no matter who is involved. As He conversed with\r\nSolomon, He categorically stated in verse 17 that if Solomon will serve Him\r\nfaithfully, do everything He has commanded and observe all the decrees and laws as\r\nHe has covenanted with his father David, He will establish his royal throne forever.\r\nNevertheless, if he, disobeys and forsakes the decrees, laws and commands and\r\nworships other gods, then He will uproot Israel from the land which He has given to\r\nthem and reject the temple which He had consecrated for His holy Name. The\r\nimplication of God's statement is that other nations will make mockery of them and\r\nask, \"Why has the Lord done such a thing to this land and to this temple?\" (v. 21). The\r\nresponse would be that they disobeyed God who had brought them out of Egypt, and served other gods. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> It is obvious from the passage that God is a jealous God. He has constantly\r\ncalled His people to demonstrate complete obedience to Him and His laws.\r\nUnfortunately, people find it difficult to obey the rules and regulations of God and\r\nconstituted authorities without minding the consequences. While some people feel\r\nthey are above the law probably because they are highly placed, others may be\r\nignorant of the consequence of such an act.

But the climax of the account in chapter 24 deals with the resurrection of\r\nJesus Christ and His appearances to His disciples on their way to Emmaus and when\r\nthey were at the table. The centrality of the Gospel is the fact that God raised His Son,\r\nJesus Christ, from the dead. It is indeed the highest earthly manifestation of the glory\r\nof God because the disciples themselves did not seem to understand how the\r\nresurrection will occur despite the fact that Jesus had repeatedly told them He would\r\nrise again on the third day (Matthew 16:21). Today's lesson focuses on the reality that\r\nJesus Christ resurrected on the third day and lives forever. We may have heard of\r\npeople who died and were brought back to life, but the difference is that they died\r\nagain. Therefore, the resurrection of Christ Jesus is the foundation and essence of the\r\nChristian faith.     <\/p>  <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n\r\n        \r\n        <h4>THE LESSON EXPLAINED<\/h4>\r\n\r\n        <ol type=\"A\">\r\n\r\n        <li>\r\n        \r\n        <h5> The Declaration of Jesus' Resurrection\r\nLuke 24:1-8 <\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> The resurrection of Jesus Christ, as declared by an angel, is one of the mysteries in\r\nhuman history. According to the account of Matthew, after the burial of Jesus, Pilate\r\nmade sure the tomb was secured, put a seal on the stone and assigned some guards to\r\nkeep watch over it (Matthew 27:65-66). That notwithstanding, on the first day of the\r\nweek, very early in the morning after the Jewish Sabbath, some women set out with\r\nspices they had prepared purposely to anoint Jesus' body as it was their tradition (Luke\r\n24:1). When they got to the tomb, the stone had been rolled away and when they\r\nentered, they did not find the body of Jesus. To their amazement, while they were still\r\nstanding and looking, probably thinking of what to do, two men in shinning clothes\r\nappeared and stood beside them. Apparently, the women recognised them as\r\nsupernatural beings, thus, they bowed down in reverence with their faces downward.\r\nThe men declared Jesus' resurrection saying, \"Why do you look for the living among\r\nthe dead? He is not here; he has risen!\" The angelic beings reminded them of Jesus'\r\nwords while in Galilee that, \"The Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful\r\nmen, be crucified and on the third day be raised again\" (v. 7). Then the women\r\nremembered what Jesus had told them about His resurrection. The women's\r\ncommitment was part of what led them to discover the different proofs of Christ's\r\nresurrection, which include the stone that had been rolled away; the absence of\r\nChrist's body in the tomb; and the angels who appeared to them. This gave them the\r\nopportunity to hear from the angels exactly what had happened and were reminded of\r\nChrist's word. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> The commitment of the women is commendable and worthy of emulation. Of\r\ncourse, they were aware of the security put in place by Pilate (the seal at the entrance\r\nof the tomb and the security guards who were placed there to watch over the body), yet\r\nthey prepared spices and courageously went to Jesus' tomb to anoint His body. They\r\nwere determined to fulfil their mission and show love to Jesus even after His death.\r\nAlthough no one saw Jesus physically as He arose from the dead, the discovery of the\r\nempty tomb and His appearances to His disciples at different times are proofs of His\r\nresurrection. Therefore, because Jesus resurrected from the dead, believers have\r\nreasons to believe in Him as well as have the hope of resurrection. Consequently, we\r\ndo not have to depend on some supposed myths to ascertain whether or not Christ rose\r\nfrom the dead. Rather, we should ask ourselves the following questions: How\r\ncommitted am I to my Saviour? What mysteries about my faith in Christ have my\r\ncommitment enabled me to solve? It is through our commitments as Christians that\r\nwe can discover hidden truths that we could use to convince our neighbours that truly\r\nChrist died and resurrected and grant salvation and life after death to those who\r\nbelieve in Him. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> What motivated the women to go to the tomb of Jesus Christ very early in the\r\nmorning without minding the dangers in doing so? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\r\n        <li> Discuss the two ways the resurrection of Jesus Christ is significant to Christians. 1\r\nCorinthians 15:12-20 <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\r\n        <li> What are the proofs of Christ's resurrection found in today's Scripture? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 3-->\r\n        <\/ol>\r\n\r\n        <\/li>\r\n\r\n\r\n <li>\r\n        \r\n        <h5> The Apostles' Disbelief\r\nLuke 24:9-12 <\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> The fact has been established that Jesus had predicted His death and resurrection\r\n(Luke 18:31-33), even though it seemed His disciples did not fully understand what\r\nHe meant. When the women (Mary Magdalene, Joanna and Mary, the mother of\r\nJames and the others with them) returned from the tomb without finding Jesus' body,\r\nthey reported everything to the apostles. Unfortunately, the apostles doubted the\r\nstory; they counted it as mere idle tales, because they had forgotten Jesus' words about\r\nHis death and resurrection, like the women. However, out of curiosity, Peter ran to the tomb\r\nto see for himself. On arrival, he saw the strips of linen lying by themselves and went away\r\npondering on what would have happened to the body of Jesus (v. 12). <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> The story of the death and resurrection of Jesus is still a mystery to many,\r\nespecially unbelievers because such has never happened in the history of the world.\r\nTherefore, unbelievers often ask questions about the possibility. Even Jesus' disciples\r\nwho were with their Master for some time and heard His predictions about the event doubted the possibility and Peter, out of curiosity, ran to the tomb to confirm it. He was\r\nsurprised that Jesus was no longer in the grave __ He had risen. Eventually, they all\r\nremembered what the Scripture and Jesus had said: He would die and rise again. The\r\nreality of the death and resurrection of Jesus is enough proof that He is faithful to His\r\nwords, therefore, believers should not doubt His promises. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> Why did the disciples doubt the testimony of Jesus' resurrection as told by the\r\nwomen? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\r\n        <li> Some Christians easily believe in people rather than God.

First, He appeared to two of His disciples (Cleopas and another) on their\r\nway to Emmaus and later to others (vv. 13-16, 36). Because it was getting dark, Jesus\r\nagreed to stay with the two disciples and He sat down to eat with them. He took bread,\r\ngave thanks, broke it and gave it to them. Immediately, their eyes were opened and\r\nthey recognised Him as Jesus but He disappeared from their sight. According to verse\r\n32, they wondered and said to each other, \"Were not our hearts burning within us\r\nwhile he talked with us on the road and opened the Scriptures to us?\" Perhaps out of\r\nbewilderment, they returned immediately to Jerusalem and found the disciples and\r\nother people with them saying, \"It is true! The Lord had risen and has appeared to\r\nSimon.\" The conviction and confession made by the eleven disciples about the risen\r\nLord prompted the two to share what had happened on their way and how they had\r\nrecognised Jesus when He broke bread (v. 35). <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> It should be noted that Jesus' appearances to His disciples has two significant\r\nimplications: it acknowledged the fact that they serve the risen Lord that works\r\naccording to His promises. Secondly, it alleviated their fears, worries and doubts\r\nabout Jesus. Consequently, the disciples were no longer overwhelmed by fear,\r\nimpossibilities, dangers, enemies, or death, the moment they were assured of the\r\nfulfilment of God's promise(s). Like the two disciples on the way to Emmaus, are we\r\nshould be interested in strengthening other believers.

Obviously, Jesus manifested\r\nHimself at different locations. He appeared to His disciples again at Sea of Tiberias.\r\nWhile the disciples were together, Simon Peter decided to go back to his old business\r\nof fishing. He said to the others, \"I'm going out to fish,\" and they responded saying,\r\n\"We'll go with you.\" That night they did not catch anything even though night is\r\nusually the most favourable time to catch fish. Without doubt, Jesus would have seen\r\ntheir fruitless effort throughout the night, thus, He chose to help them. According to\r\nverses 4 and 6, He stood on the seashore and said to them, \"Friends haven't you any\r\nfish?\" \"No\" they answered, and He said, \"Throw your net on the right side of the boat\r\nand you will find some.\" Despite the fact that the disciples did not recognise Him (v. 4),\r\nthey obeyed His instruction and they caught a large number of fish. Immediately, one\r\nof the disciples whom Jesus loved recognised. Jesus said to Peter, \"It is the Lord\". The\r\ndeclaration prompted Peter to throw his garment around himself and jump into the\r\nwater while the other disciples pulled the net full of fish. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> The Bible did not state categorically the reasons Peter and the other disciples went\r\nback to their fishing profession. Nonetheless, it is obvious they were unsure of their\r\nfuture and in the interim, they chose not to be idle. However, there experiment ended\r\nin fruitlessness until the risen Lord appeared to them. Today, Christians need to ask\r\nthemselves how faithful they are to the assignment committed to their hands by God\r\nor the assignment delegated to them by their pastor. Jesus appearance to the disciples\r\nreminds and gives us hope that Christ will one day appear again to judge the world.\r\nWhat will be our lot? Also, the disciples' inability to catch fish might be an indication\r\nof doing the wrong business. People with God's calling upon their lives can as well\r\nhave such an experience if they abandon the ministry work God has called them to do.\r\nPerhaps the present turbulence in your business is due to such? Repent like Peter did.\r\nSome people have argued that the miracle of the great catch was a symbol of the great\r\nsuccess of the redemptive movement among humankind (the Great Commission),\r\nwhich Jesus initiated. Believers should learn to obey Jesus\\' command, no matter how\r\ndifficult it may seem because it will be rewarding just as it was with the disciples. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> Why did the disciples not immediately recognise Jesus? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\r\n        <li> Discuss Peter's action in verse 7b and its implication for believers.

His\r\nappearances to His disciples further prove of His resurrection. Indeed, He knew their\r\nemotional state after His death and burial and was ready to deal with it. Therefore, He\r\nasked for some fish, then invited them to eat breakfast to prove to them that He was\r\nJesus. In addition, Jesus' invitation to His disciples to eat was purposely to allay their\r\nfears and worries and probably to prove to them that He is truly the Lord. Are you in\r\ndoubt of Christ's resurrection? By eating with His disciples, Jesus confirmed that He\r\nwas not a ghost but a living being. If you have been discouraged concerning the\r\nassignment the Lord has given you and contemplated quitting, would you respond to\r\nChrist's effort to restore you? Would you obey His command as His disciples did? It is\r\nin obedience that true restoration can occur. One of the striking lessons in the passage\r\nis that the disciples could not catch any fish in spite of their hard labour. Without the\r\nhelp of Jesus, we are helpless. Therefore, we should depend on Him and respond to\r\nHis invitation to save. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> Compare and contrast the experience of the death of a loved one with those of the\r\ndisciples who thought they would never see Jesus again <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\r\n        <li> Discuss the implication of Jesus' invitation in verse 12. <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\r\n        <li> What is the significance of the fish and bread Jesus gave to His disciples? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 3-->\r\n        <\/ol>\r\n\r\n        <\/li>\r\n\r\n        <\/ol>\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h4> Prayer Points <\/h4>\r\n        <ul>\r\n        <li> Pray and thank God for the risen Lord through whom we have hope. <\/li> <!-- Prayer Point 1-->\r\n        <li> Uphold me with Your grace, O God, that I will not doubt You and what You can do. <\/li> <!-- Prayer Point 2-->\r\n        <li> Lord, I surrender myself to You today, receive me into Your loving hands. <\/li> <!-- Prayer Point 3-->\r\n        <\/ul>\r\n\r\n             <h4> Fellowship and Ministry Building Activities <\/h4>\r\n        <ul>\r\n        <li> Ask class members to discuss experiences in which they feel Christ directed\r\nthem and\/or empowered them and made them succeed at something they had\r\npreviously failed at. <\/li> <!-- Fellowship Activity 1-->\r\n       \r\n        <\/ul>\r\n\r\n           <h4> Take Home <\/h4>\r\n        \r\n        <ul>\r\n        \r\n        <li> We can do nothing on our own except God helps us. <\/li> <!-- Take Home 1-->\r\n        <li> Our struggles and hope can be restored with the help of the risen Lord <\/li> <!-- Take Home 2-->\r\n        <li> Jesus is the Bread of Life who provides for all our needs. <\/li> <!-- Take Home 2-->\r\n        <li> It is rewarding to obey Jesus' command. <\/li> <!-- Take Home 2--> \r\n        <\/ul><\/p>"},{"id":"15","title":"FOLLOW ME","message":"<p><center>\r\n\r\n            <h4> April 15, 2018 <\/h4> <!--DATE-->\r\n            <h3> FOLLOW ME <\/h3> <!--TOPIC-->\r\n\r\n        <p>\r\n        <p> Devotional Reading: Matthew 10:5-15 <\/p> <!--Devotional Reading Passage-->\r\n        <p> Background Scripture \/ Lesson Scripture: Matthew 10:5-15 <\/p> <!-- Background Scipture Passage-->\r\n      \r\n        <\/p>\r\n\r\n        <h4>Golden Text<\/h4>\r\n\r\n        <p> When they had finished eating, Jesus said to Simon Peter, \u201cSimon son of John, do\r\nyou truly love me more than these?\u201d \u201cYes, Lord,\u201d he said, \u201cyou know that I love\r\nyou.\u201d Jesus said, \u201cFeed my lambs.\u201d\r\n<b>John 21:15<\/b> <\/p> <!-- Golden Text; Make Sure the scripture passage is made bold-->\r\n\r\n<\/center>\r\n\r\n        <h4>Objectives :<\/h4>\r\n        <p>By the end of the lesson, class members should be able to:<\/p>\r\n\r\n        <ul>\r\n        <li> Explain the various ways we can\r\nshow our sincere love to God and\r\nhumankind. <\/li>   <!-- Objective 1-->\r\n        <li> Discuss the reasons for Jesus'\r\nrepeated question to Peter. <\/li>   <!-- Objective 2-->\r\n        <li> Express their decision to follow Jesus\r\nChrist in totality with a prayer of\r\ncommitment. <\/li>   <!-- Objective 3-->\r\n        <\/ul>\r\n\r\n        <h4>INTRODUCTION<\/h4>\r\n        <p>     Mr George Asabaor is a\r\nrenowned politician. He had\r\noccupied some important\r\npolitical positions in time past with good\r\nrecords of performance. Consequently,\r\npeople, especially the youths, loved him\r\nand wanted him to continue in office.\r\nSome years later, he made his interest\r\nknown to run for the gubernatorial\r\nposition in his state. Almost immediately, his supporters started to move from one place to another canvassing for the votes of\r\nthe electorate. In his attempt to convince the electorate of what he is capable of doing,\r\nhe would remove his cap, point to his grey hair and say, \"This is experience, so vote for\r\nme and follow me because I know the way\". In fact, the people were thrilled by his\r\npromises and resolved to vote for him. No sooner had he assumed office than he was\r\nalleged of fraud and all kinds of political misconduct. He was nicknamed \"Baba\r\nfollow me\" when actually he does not know the road. Eventually, he was disgraced out\r\nof office. This story is useful for today's lesson as we see Peter who seemed to be a\r\ngood leader before Christ's death but somehow failed after Christ's death.   <\/p>  <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n\r\n        <p>    Today's lesson focuses on Jesus' command to Peter three times to feed His flock.\r\nAfter Peter's denial of Jesus (John 18:17, 25-27), Jesus restored him to his former\r\nposition as a leader, and gave him the task of caring for His people whom He called\r\n\"sheep\". The call to leadership became necessary, especially as Jesus was about to\r\nascend. As believers, Jesus is our perfect example. As He called Peter into a leadership\r\nposition so He is calling all believers to follow Him today because He is the Way, the\r\nTruth and the Life.    <\/p>  <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n\r\n        \r\n        <h4>THE LESSON EXPLAINED<\/h4>\r\n\r\n        <ol type=\"A\">\r\n\r\n        <li>\r\n        \r\n        <h5> The Command to Follow\r\nJohn 21:15-19 <\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> As Jesus' time with His disciples after His resurrection was coming to an end, He\r\ndecided to reinstate Peter immediately after their meal. Jesus three times asked Peter if\r\nhe loved Him and Peter's affirmative answers was followed with a command to feed\r\nJesus' lambs and take care of His sheep (vv. 15-17). In the Greek text, Peter's answers\r\nto Jesus for the first and second times indicated that the Greek word translated 'love'\r\nused by Peter was a kind of brotherly love, while Jesus meant agape love. It seems\r\nPeter came to this understanding the third time. After the third question, which made\r\nhim sad, Jesus told him again, \"Feed my sheep.\" In other words, Jesus wants Peter to\r\nassume leadership position after His ascension and be responsible to all. The\r\ninstructions, 'feed my lamb' and 'take care of my sheep' indicate Peter's leadership role\r\namong the disciples. Moreover, in verses 18-19, Jesus spoke to Peter about his death\r\nwhich will bring glory to God. He also commanded him to follow Him, by\r\nimplication, to walk in His ways. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> The dialogue between Jesus and Peter was very interesting. Jesus' questions to him\r\nwere, in effect, asking if he really understood the task of his new position to nourish\r\nand care for His people. So, while Peter seemed to have become exasperated, he later\r\ncame to a fuller realisation of what exactly Jesus was asking him to do. Apparently,\r\nPeter affirmed his love for Jesus. This lesson, therefore, is a call for Christians to\r\nrenew their love and commitment to follow God. This can be done through our sincere\r\nservices, love to humankind and God. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> Discuss the possible reasons why Jesus repeated the command to feed His lamb\r\nto Peter. <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\r\n        <li> What might be required of someone wishing to restore a relationship with\r\nothers after a relational breach?

Although the name of the disciple was not disclosed throughout the Scripture\r\nhe was described in this passage as the one who had leaned close to Jesus at the table.\r\nAncient tradition identified him as Apostle John, the son of Zebedee. It is obvious that\r\nPeter was surprised to see this same disciple following them; thus, he said to Jesus,\r\n\"Lord, what about him?\" Perhaps he wanted clarification whether he is included in the\r\ncommand to follow Him. Nevertheless, Jesus simply said, \"If I want him to remain\r\nalive until I return, what is that to you? You must follow me\" (v. 22). Consequently,\r\nthere was a misconception and rumour about Jesus' statement among the brethren.\r\nThey thought Jesus meant that the disciple would live and not die until He returns,\r\nwhereas Jesus only meant that He has the authority to let him live until He returns (His\r\nsecond coming). <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> Jesus response to Peter's question seems to tell us that He has revealed to us what\r\nwe need to know.

The focus of today's lesson is\r\nthe privilege of a full revelation of heavenly worship, which John had through visions\r\nat different times. In order for him to understand the heavenly events, which are\r\nrelated to the future of all the redeemed, God communicated with him using various\r\nsymbols. The symbols are not just ordinary narratives, allegories, fiction or fable but\r\nreal events that happened around the throne of God in heaven. Little wonder reading\r\nthe book of Revelation is like taking a journey to a distant country with strange\r\ncustoms and unknown language. It is, of course, obvious that God wanted John to\r\nhave an understanding of the message. Even today, God still speaks to His people\r\nthrough different signs and symbols. What matters is the willingness to study and\r\nunderstand God's Word and apply it appropriately.     <\/p>  <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n\r\n        \r\n        <h4>THE LESSON EXPLAINED<\/h4>\r\n\r\n        <ol type=\"A\">\r\n\r\n        <li>\r\n        \r\n        <h5> The Vision of an Open Heaven\r\nRevelation 4:1-3 <\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> John's vision was in sequence. Apart from the previous revelations of the seven\r\nchurches and the different messages for each, he had another vision. This vision was\r\nabout the heavenly worship experience around the throne of God. It was a vision of an\r\nopen door in heaven with the sound of a trumpet and an invitation to him saying,\r\n\"Come up here, and I will show you what must take place after this.\" (v. 1b) The phrase\r\n\"I will show you\" means visions concerning the future and the command \u201ccome up\r\nhere\u201d refers specifically to the change in the scene in which John was to receive\r\nrevelation about future events. Immediately, he was in the Spirit and was able to see\r\nthe throne in heaven with someone sitting on it whose appearance looked like jasper\r\nand carnelian (a red stone with glittering features). The expression means that the\r\nHoly Spirit gave him a vision, showing him situations and events he could not have\r\nseen with his physical eyes. He also saw a rainbow that resembled an emerald (rock\r\ncrystal which acts as a prism, breaking up light into the colours of the rainbow\r\n(Ezekiel 1:28). It encircled the throne. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> Without doubt, the voice that sounded like a trumpet was the voice of Jesus Christ\r\nthat unfolded the events around the throne of God so that it will be recorded. John's\r\nvision of Christ under the influence of the Holy Spirit was a landmark in his ministry.\r\nHe was given the opportunity to see beyond the physical __ an open heaven and God\r\nsitting on His throne. It is also worth mentioning that the description of the use of\r\ntrumpet is partly influenced by the Old Testament tradition of God calling His people\r\nto witness great events that are yet to come. According to some Bible scholars, the\r\nsymbols in the passage describe the radiance of God's throne while the door, here,\r\nsignifies entrance by way of revelation into heaven. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> Discuss the significance of John's vision <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\r\n        <li> In what ways can we recognise the presence of God Almighty in our midst\r\ntoday? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\r\n        <li> Why do some people use diabolical means to see vision today and how can we\r\novercome such practices? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 3-->\r\n        <\/ol>\r\n\r\n        <\/li>\r\n\r\n<li>\r\n        \r\n       \r\n        <h5> God Communicates His Message\r\nRevelation 4:4-8 <\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> The fact has been established that John had his vision in stages. From verse 4, God\r\nrevealed to him the nature of the throne and the different symbols. In particular, John\r\ntook note of the twenty-four elders who were clothed in white robes and crowns of\r\ngold; sitting on twenty-four thrones around the throne of God. In front of the throne\r\nwere different elements of flashes of lightning, rumblings and peals of thunder, seven\r\nlit torches. Usually, lightning and thunder are connected with significant events in\r\nheaven and in the Old Testament, such imagery were used to reflect God's power and\r\nmajesty (Psalm 77:18). The elements symbolise the seven spirits of God or the Holy\r\nSpirit in the work of illumination and revelation of God's Word to humankind. Other\r\ncreatures like lion, bull, human face, and eagle with six wings also surrounded the\r\nthrone. Interestingly, these creatures recognise the mightiness of God; therefore, they\r\ncontinually praise Him saying, \"Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty, who was,\r\nwho is, and is to come.\" These living creatures were united in their constant praise of\r\nGod for His eternal holiness. Though not exactly like the cherubim seen by Prophet\r\nEzekiel (Ezekiel 10:1-10), they appeared to serve similar functions. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> God still communicates His messages through humankind using various familiar\r\nsymbols like the case of John in his vision. Because He is God and always desires that\r\nHis people will understand His plan and purpose for them, He sometimes speaks to us\r\nusing different familiar symbols. Whenever He does that, it shows His willingness to\r\nbe understood. Therefore, we should recognise that every representation in this\r\npassage is meaningful, symbolic and it speaks of God's power and glory, day and\r\nnight. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> Discuss various types of worship symbols you use in your church and explain their\r\nimportance. <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\r\n        <li> The revelation of God's holiness stimulates us to worship and praise Him.

They\r\ncontinually sing songs of glory and honour and thanksgiving to Him who sits on the\r\nthrone. The phrase \"him who sits on the throne\" was a direct way the Jews and early\r\nChristians expressed reverence to God. Also, it was an attempt to describe the act of\r\nceaseless worship in heaven. Particularly, the activities of the four creatures are\r\ndescribed in verse 8, \"Day and night they never stop saying: \"Holy, holy, holy is the\r\nLord God Almighty.\" As it is seen in the passage, the song often prompts the twenty-\r\nfour elders to fall down before Him who sits on the throne and worship Him because\r\nHe lives forever and ever. As part of showing reverence to God, they lay their crowns\r\nbefore the throne and say: \"You are worthy, our Lord and God, to receive glory and\r\nhonour and power, for you created all things, and by your will they were created and\r\nhave their being\u201d (v. 11). Their style of worship is worthy of emulation, especially the\r\nremoval of their crowns and bowing down; these are all symbols of emptying oneself\r\nand humility. It also shows respect for God who lives forever and ever. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> The passage is a reminder that God is worthy of our praises and honour because He\r\ncreated and sustains all things. Apostle John's description of the activities in heaven\r\nreminds us that we serve a God of order and harmony who deserves praise and honour.\r\nThe entire vision shows a portrait of God, His awesomeness and dignity. It, therefore,\r\nconfirms that praise and worship to God are constantly on-going in heaven. As a\r\nresult, Christians should continuously praise and worship God because He is the\r\nCreator and Sustainer of all things. We should worship Him with songs of praise,\r\ndancing, our time and other resources at our disposal. This should be done in humility\r\njust like the twenty-four elders remove their crowns, as a sign of humility. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> Identify some things Christians are expected to forsake in order to worship God in\r\nsincerity. <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\r\n        <li> Suggest some ways of improving praise worship in your church. <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\r\n       \r\n     \r\n        <\/ol>\r\n\r\n        <\/li>\r\n\r\n\r\n        <\/ol>\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h4> Prayer Points <\/h4>\r\n        <ul>\r\n        <li> Pray and ask God to open your eyes and give you understanding of how to praise Him better. <\/li> <!-- Prayer Point 1-->\r\n        <li> Ask the Lord to count you worthy to praise Him with the saints at the end of age. <\/li> <!-- Prayer Point 2-->\r\n        <li> Pray that your life will be characterised with praise and sincere worship. <\/li> <!-- Prayer Point 3-->\r\n        <\/ul>\r\n\r\n             <h4> Fellowship and Ministry Building Activities <\/h4>\r\n        <ul>\r\n        <li> Let each class member write at least ten things that make God worthy of honour\r\nand praise. <\/li> <!-- Fellowship Activity 1-->\r\n        <li> Sing together BH 1: Holy, Holy, Holy and pray for grace to always praise and\r\nhonour God. <\/li> <!-- Fellowship Activity 2-->\r\n        <\/ul>\r\n\r\n           <h4> Take Home <\/h4>\r\n        \r\n        <ul>\r\n        \r\n        <li> Christians should learn to praise God all the time because He is worthy of our\r\npraise. <\/li> <!-- Take Home 1-->\r\n        <li> God alone should be our object of worship. <\/li> <!-- Take Home 2-->\r\n        <li> God can choose to speak to His people through any means. <\/li> <!-- Take Home 2-->\r\n        <li> One of the attributes of God is holiness. <\/li> <!-- Take Home 2-->    \r\n        <\/ul><\/p>"},{"id":"17","title":"BLESSING, GLORY, HONOUR FOREVER ","message":"<p><center>\r\n\r\n            <h4> April 29, 2018 <\/h4> <!--DATE-->\r\n            <h3> BLESSING, GLORY, HONOUR FOREVER <\/h3> <!--TOPIC-->\r\n\r\n        <p>\r\n        <p> Devotional Reading: Philippians 2:1-11 <\/p> <!--Devotional Reading Passage-->\r\n        <p> Background Scripture: Revelation 5:6-14 <\/p> <!-- Background Scipture Passage-->\r\n        <p> Lesson Scripture: Revelation 5:1-14 <\/p> <!-- Lesson Scipture Passage-->\r\n        <\/p>\r\n\r\n        <h4>Golden Text<\/h4>\r\n\r\n        <p> In a loud voice they sang: \"Worthy is the Lamb, who was slain, to receive power\r\nand wealth and wisdom and strength and honour and glory and praise!\"\r\n<b>Revelation 5:12<\/b> <\/p> <!-- Golden Text; Make Sure the scripture passage is made bold-->\r\n\r\n<\/center>\r\n\r\n        <h4>Objectives :<\/h4>\r\n        <p>By the end of the lesson, class members should be able to:<\/p>\r\n\r\n        <ul>\r\n        <li> Mention at least four characteristics\r\nof the Lamb. <\/li>   <!-- Objective 1-->\r\n        <li> State clearly what was revealed about\r\nthe Lamb (Jesus) and what He has\r\naccomplished through His death. <\/li>   <!-- Objective 2-->\r\n        <li> Write down what they will do in order\r\nto give God worthy worship. <\/li>   <!-- Objective 3-->\r\n        <\/ul>\r\n\r\n        <h4>INTRODUCTION<\/h4>\r\n        <p>    It was another Sunday morning and as\r\nusual, the children were engaged in\r\ndifferent activities according to their\r\nage groups. One of the boys in younger\r\nchildren's class was engrossed with\r\ndrawing and colouring a highly\r\ncomplicated picture. Having watched\r\nhim with keen interest, the teacher\r\nwalked up to him and said, \"What are you\r\ndrawing, my dear?\" The boy responded\r\nwithout lifting his head, \"I am drawing\r\nthe picture of God.\" \"That is very good,\r\nbut do you know that no one knows exactly what God looks like\", said the teacher. \"They will now know with my\r\npicture\", was the boy's response. The effort of John in the book of Revelation can be\r\nlikened to what the little boy did in his attempt to draw the picture of God.    <\/p>  <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n\r\n        <p> Today's lesson is a continuation of the vision in chapter 4, that is, the ceaseless\r\nworship in heaven. In John's vision, he carefully described the scroll and the Lamb\r\n(the One seated on the throne). As the plan of his vision unfolded, what was unspoken\r\nbecame open. In fact, the fifth chapter of the book of Revelation is a key chapter that\r\nintroduces us to some scenes and characters in heaven. Mainly, it contains the worship\r\nof Christ, the Son, by the heavenly hosts. <\/p>  <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n\r\n        \r\n        <h4>THE LESSON EXPLAINED<\/h4>\r\n\r\n        <ol type=\"A\">\r\n\r\n        <li>\r\n        \r\n        <h5> Vision of the Scroll\r\nRevelation 5:1-5 <\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> The scene that began in chapter 4, when John was invited to behold some future\r\nevents continued in chapter 5. In this vision, John's attention was drawn primarily to\r\nthe scroll and the Lamb. He saw the scroll in the right hand of Him who sits on the\r\nthrone covered with writing on both sides and a mighty angel who proclaimed in a\r\nloud voice, \"Who is worthy to break the seals and open the scroll?\" (v. 2)\r\nUnfortunately, it seemed no one met the criteria to open the scroll in heaven or on\r\nearth. This made John weep profusely until he was consoled by one of the elders that\r\nthe Lion of the tribe of Judah, the great descendant of David has triumphed. Therefore,\r\nHe is qualified to break the seven seals and open the scroll. The two phrases describe\r\nChrist, the Slain and Risen Lamb who alone is confirmed to be worthy to open the scroll.\r\nOf course, this presupposes the fact that Jesus, the Lamb of God has the right to open the\r\nscroll not only by virtue of His power (as the Lion of the tribe of Judah) but also through\r\nHis sacrificial death (as the Slain Lamb), which has brought salvation to humankind. The\r\ntwo phrases are very significant in John's vision because they both describe Jesus as the\r\nSlain and Risen Lamb who is worthy to open the scroll. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> It is evident that Jesus, the Lamb of God who alone has the authority to reveal\r\nGod\\'s secrets, was qualified to open the scroll. According to some Bible\r\ncommentators, the scrolls at that time usually contain writings on both sides and\r\nsealed with seven seals. The writings on both sides often emphasise their ability to\r\naccomplish the purposes of God and the number seven represents the absolute\r\nsacredness of the scroll. It was this same scroll that no one was capable of opening\r\nexcept Jesus, the Lamb, who is our Deliverer, Saviour and Mediator. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> List the attributes of the Lamb as described in the passage. <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\r\n        <li> Why is it that no one was qualified to open the scroll except Jesus Christ who has\r\nwon the victory? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\r\n      \r\n        <\/ol>\r\n\r\n        <\/li>\r\n\r\n  <li>\r\n        \r\n        <h5> Vision of the Lamb\r\nRevelation 5:6-10 <\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> John's vision was successive and explicit. Having been invited to behold some future events\r\nin the first few verses of the passage, John suddenly saw a Lamb standing at the centre of the\r\nthrone as though already slain (Isaiah 53:7). He was surrounded by four living creatures and\r\nthe elders. He had seven horns and seven eyes representing seven spirits of God that have\r\nbeen sent throughout the whole earth (v. 6). According to verse 7, the Lamb took the scroll\r\nfrom Him who sits on the throne. The event prompted the four living creatures and the\r\ntwenty-four elders to bow down before the Lamb in worship. Each had a harp and golden\r\nbowl, which John identified as the prayers of God\\'s own people who have been set apart for\r\nGod. They worshipped and sang a new song: \"You are worthy to take the scroll and to open\r\nits seals, because you were slain, and with your blood you purchased men for God from\r\nevery tribe and language and people and nation.\" Ultimately, this song of praise explains\r\nwhy the Lamb is worthy to open the scroll: by His sacrificial death, we have been reconciled\r\nto God. Consequently, it has made the people a kingdom and priests to serve God, because\r\nthey will reign on earth (v. 10). <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> Remarkably, the scroll refers to the prophecy of this book; a revelation of the\r\ncomplete redemptive plan of God through human history to eternity. Interestingly, the\r\nredemptive plan of God was fulfilled in Revelation 21:6 when God said, \"It is done ....\"\r\nFurthermore, it is apparent that praise and worship of the four creatures and twenty-four\r\nelders form the content of the song, which of course is the summary of the victory of the\r\nLamb. Therefore, Christians proclaim Jesus' worthiness on the basis of His redemptive\r\npower with which He has made them a kingdom of priests to serve God through His\r\nsacrificial death (Revelation 1:5-6; 1 Peter 2:9), and they shall rule on earth. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> According to the lesson, state two benefits of Jesus' death. <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\r\n        <li> Identify the differences between the heavenly worship as seen in today's passage\r\nand the way we worship today. <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\r\n      \r\n        <\/ol>\r\n\r\n        <\/li>\r\n        \r\n          <li>\r\n        \r\n        <h5> Praise to the Lamb\r\nRevelation 5:11-14 <\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> It was confirmed in the previous lesson that the death of Jesus Christ has a universal\r\neffect, therefore, the redeemed have the right to serve God as kingdom priests. The\r\nscene that followed the song of praise to the Lamb was the voice of innumerable\r\ncompany of angels that surrounded the throne. Suddenly, John heard them saying\r\nwith a loud voice, \"Worthy is the Lamb, who was slain, to receive power and wealth\r\nand wisdom and strength and honour and glory and praise!\" (v. 12) He also heard the\r\nvoice of every creature in heaven, on earth, under the earth and in the sea singing\r\npraises in honour of Him who sits on the throne and the Lamb. The four living\r\ncreatures responded by saying, \"Amen\" while the elders fell down and worshipped. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> No doubt, this vision is similar to Daniel's vision when he saw countless multitude\r\nbefore the Ancient of Days and the books were opened (Daniel 7:9-10). This passage\r\nis a reminder that all creation should acknowledge that Jesus is Lord. This confirms\r\nthat whether one likes it or not, every creation wherever found; religion and race\r\nnotwithstanding, will at last worship the Lord Jesus as the only living God (v. 13). This\r\nis essentially important because He has completed the work given to Him by His\r\nFather and has restored humankind from their fallen state, thus He is worthy of our\r\npraise. Therefore, we can praise God corporately or individually for the way He works\r\nin the lives of His people like the elders and the four creatures in the passage. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> In line with today's passage, discuss the common saying that, 'the only work in\r\nheaven is praising God.' <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\r\n        <li> Mention some things believers can emulate from verses 11-13 as we worship God. <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\r\n       \r\n        <\/ol>\r\n\r\n        <\/li>\r\n\r\n        <\/ol>\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h4> Prayer Points <\/h4>\r\n        <ul>\r\n        <li> Praise God for His plan of salvation through the blood of His Son, Jesus Christ. <\/li> <!-- Prayer Point 1-->\r\n        <li> Lord, teach me to worship you in an acceptable way. <\/li> <!-- Prayer Point 2-->\r\n        <li> Lord, count me worthy to be among the saints who will praise and worship You in\r\nheaven ceaselessly. <\/li> <!-- Prayer Point 3-->\r\n        <\/ul>\r\n\r\n             <h4> Fellowship and Ministry Building Activities <\/h4>\r\n        <ul>\r\n        <li> Compare and contrast the heavenly worship, as described in today's passage with\r\nthe style of worship in your church.

Few weeks after\r\nhis assumption of office, he saw the need\r\nfor the construction of a new church\r\nbuilding and purchase of modern\r\nequipment. Having prayed and was\r\nconvinced of God's approval, he made his plan known to the members of the church. Interestingly, they were willing to support\r\nhim with their resources and prayers. The members met and encouraged one another\r\non the need to support the pastor's vision and almost immediately the construction\r\nwork began. Some of the people offered free services while others donated money and\r\nother material gifts for the completion of the project. Before the stipulated time, the\r\nwork was completed and dedicated for use. The attitude of the people can be likened\r\nto the people of Israel who responded to the call of Moses to give generously when the\r\nTabernacle of the Lord was to be constructed.   <\/p>  <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n\r\n        <p>     The book of Exodus records the movement of the Israelites from Egypt, as well\r\nas the various instructions God gave them in the course of their journey to the\r\nPromised Land. One of such instructions was the construction of the Tabernacle\r\n(Exodus 25-27). They were expected to provide the materials to be used for the\r\nconstruction of the tabernacle. The instruction was carried out to the letter. They all\r\nresponded by providing the materials for the construction and furnishing of the\r\nTabernacle. By this singular act, God taught the Israelites the principle of giving. This\r\nsame concept of generous giving was emphasised by Paul in his letter to the\r\nCorinthian church (2 Corinthians 9:6). According to Paul, he was aware of their\r\nhardship, yet he encouraged them to give to support their fellow brothers and sisters in\r\nJerusalem just like the Macedonians had done despite their troubles.   <\/p>  <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n\r\n        \r\n        <h4>THE LESSON EXPLAINED<\/h4>\r\n\r\n        <ol type=\"A\">\r\n\r\n        <li>\r\n        \r\n        <h5> A Willing Heart\r\nExodus 35:20-22 <\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> The Israelites heard the commands of the Lord through Moses with reference the\r\nbuilding of the tabernacle. Among the commands was generous giving for the\r\nconstruction of the tabernacle of the Lord. The people responded positively to Moses'\r\nappeal. According to verse 21, those who were willing and whose hearts moved them\r\nto give came with their offerings for the construction work. They brought their gold\r\njewelry of various kinds, brooches, earrings, rings and beautiful ornaments and\r\npresented them as wave offerings to the Lord. Certainly, the people understood the\r\nfact that God is capable of providing the needed material without involving them, but\r\nHe has only chosen to involve them in the work of the tent of meeting. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> Having listened to Moses' narration, the people allowed the Lord to speak to\r\nthem about what to bring instead of being coerced (v. 20). This of course is an\r\nindication of a willing heart, which is God's standard for His people. In addition, their\r\nresponse is an indication that they believed in Moses as God's messenger and that God\r\nowned everything in their possession. But today, there are different people in the\r\nchurch of God: those who are compelled to give and those who are insensitive to the\r\nthings of God. In some cases, leaders place curses on people who fail to give. This\r\nattitude is ungodly and selfish. The message in the passage is that giving must come\r\nfrom a willing heart because God only accepts offerings that come from willing hearts. Giving is also an element of our worship to God, this was evident in the\r\npresentation of gold (valuable substance, which in our generation includes money) as\r\nwave offering to the Lord. A true worshipper gives God quality offering to meet a need\r\nin the church. It may also be necessary for us as Christians to allow God to speak to us\r\non how to meet needs in the church for the expansion of His work. More so, God will\r\nnot demand that you give what He has not already provided for you. He will not ask\r\nyou to give what you do not have at your disposal. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> Discuss why some people are not willing to give to the work of God in their various\r\nchurches. <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\r\n        <li> What are the likely dangers of compelling people to give to God? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\r\n        <li> Why did the people respond to Moses' appeal for generous giving? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 3-->\r\n        <\/ol>\r\n\r\n        <\/li>\r\n\r\n <li>\r\n        \r\n        <h5> Everyone Was Involved\r\nExodus 35:23-29 <\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> The importance of teamwork in achieving success in whatever facet of life cannot be\r\noveremphasised as it is seen in the passage. The instruction on generous giving which\r\nwas given to Moses about the construction of the tabernacle was all-embracing as the\r\npeople presented their gifts as offering unto the Lord. The passage shows that no one\r\nwas excluded in the provision of the resources needed for the building of the\r\ntabernacle. Particularly, every skilled woman used her expertise and brought what she\r\nhad spun (blue, purple or scarlet yarn or fine linen) to the Lord at no cost (v. 25).\r\nFurthermore, the leaders were exemplary in their giving __ they brought onyx stones\r\nand other gems to be set for the ephod and breastpiece, spices and olive oil for the light\r\nand anointing oil (vv. 27-28). In fact, the collaborative effort demonstrated by the\r\npeople is worthy of emulation by contemporary Christians. All the men and women\r\nwho were willing brought their freewill offerings for the completion of the tabernacle\r\nas Moses had commanded them (v. 29). <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> The spirit of cooperation and enthusiasm that was demonstrated by the people of\r\nIsrael is worth emulating. From verse 25, everyone involved brought their resources,\r\nno matter how little it seemed. They were passionate about the completion of the\r\ntabernacle for the worship of God. The implication, therefore, is that no one should be\r\nexempted from making provision for the progress of the work of God. Both the leaders\r\nand the led, men and women, should ensure that they play their parts in giving, as God\r\nspeaks to them. It is, however, sad that some Christians find it difficult to give for the\r\nadvancement of God's work. What is commonly seen today is that while some\r\nChristians complain they do not have enough, some others refuse to give willingly and\r\nadequately because they are ignorant of the blessings that come with giving. Our challenge from today's lesson is that artisans in our churches should be willing to use\r\ntheir technical know-how in the construction and beautification of church buildings,\r\nwhenever the need arises, with little or no charges.

Members\r\nof that community were predominantly\r\nfarmers. One Sunday morning, as he\r\nentered into the church, he was surprised\r\nto find some tubers of yam on the floor\r\nbeside the pulpit. He was puzzled so, he\r\nasked an elderly man about the reason for\r\nbringing tubers of yam to the church.\r\nWith a smile, the elderly man replied, \"This is the first fruit from my farm. I have brought it to you as it has been our practice\r\nin this church.\" He explained further that it is according to God's command about first\r\nfruits. Throughout the period of his pastorate in the church, bringing first fruits to the\r\nLord became more meaningful to the pastor. The more the members were committed\r\nto the practice, the more they experienced God's bountiful blessings.   <\/p>  <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n\r\n        <p>     Leviticus chapter 23 deals with three great annual feasts God commanded the\r\nchildren of Israel to observe during which all Israelite males would go to Jerusalem.\r\nOne of such feasts was the Feast of Firstfruits. It usually falls on the sixteenth day of\r\nthe first month of the Jewish calendar (Abib), with its contemporary equivalent as\r\nMarch\/April. It signifies the dedication of harvest to the Lord as well as celebrating\r\nGod, who has made them to witness another harvest. As partakers of the saving grace\r\nof God, Christians have a lot to learn, adopt and practice from these Jewish feasts and\r\nas another dimension of generous giving.   <\/p>  <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n\r\n        \r\n        <h4>THE LESSON EXPLAINED<\/h4>\r\n\r\n        <ol type=\"A\">\r\n\r\n        <li>\r\n        \r\n        <h5> First Fruit: A Divine Command\r\nLeviticus 23:9-13 <\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> The relationship between God and Moses was cordial. From time to time, God\r\ncommunicated with him as he played the role of an intermediary between Him and the\r\npeople of Israel. In the first few verses of Leviticus chapter 23, Moses was\r\ncommanded to instruct the children of Israel about the observance of three important\r\nfeasts which must be celebrated by them. They include the Sabbath (v. 3), the Passover\r\nand the Festival of Unleavened Bread (vv. 4-8) and the Firstfruits (vv. `9-14).\r\nPrincipally, the Feast of the Firstfruit was to be observed when they enter the Promised\r\nLand after harvest (v. 10). The feast was to be in two stages.\r\n        <\/p><ul>\r\n        <li> They shall take a sheaf of the harvest to the priest who will present it as offering\r\nunto the Lord.

It is important to note that the waving of the\r\nsheaf must take place on the day after the Sabbath. <\/li>\r\n        <li> They were also to make sacrifices of a burnt offering of a lamb without blemish (v.\r\n12), a grain offering of two tenths of an ephah and an offering of one litre of wine\r\n(v. 13). The offerings should be made by fire, and the smell pleasing to God. <\/li> \r\n        <\/ul>   <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> The command to celebrate the Feast of Firstfruits was from God. It was to remind\r\nthe Israelites that the land upon which they farmed was a gift to them from God and the\r\nharvest was only made possible by God. In like manner, Christians are expected to\r\ncelebrate the blessings of God through generous giving and with particular emphasis\r\non the first fruit, which could be the first proceed from whatever job we do. More\r\nimportantly, believers should see such a celebration as a way of showing gratitude to\r\nGod, without whom our labour would have amounted to nothing. However, leaders of\r\nGod\\'s people should be wary of instituting 'feasts' that are not godly in order to\r\nincrease the income of the church without receiving clear instructions from God. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> What are the things that could represent first fruits for various categories of\r\nworkers (civil servants, traders, artisans, etc.)? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\r\n        <li> Identify some church traditions that have become a burden to the people and\r\nsuggest ways to avoid them. <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\r\n      \r\n        <\/ol>\r\n\r\n        <\/li>\r\n\r\n <li>\r\n        \r\n        <h5> Put God First\r\nLeviticus 23:14 <\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> God's instruction to Moses concerning the celebration of the Feast of Firstfruits was\r\nclear and straightforward. Having instructed them on the two stages of the\r\ncelebration, God gave them stern warning that, \"You must not eat any bread, or\r\nroasted or new grain, until the very day you bring this offering to your God\" (v 14).\r\nThey were not to eat from the fruits of their labour except God's due portion is given\r\nHim. This of course places emphasis on the importance of putting God first. Even\r\nwhen they are tempted, they must remember that the Lord forbids them from taking\r\nany portion of the harvest before giving the first fruit. It is interesting to note that God\r\nstated clearly that this is not an ordinance for a particular generation, but \u201c... a lasting\r\nordinance for the generations to come, wherever you live.\u201d (v. 14b) <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> It is apparent from the passage that present-day believers are not exempted from\r\nthis divine principle of first fruit. God desires to be the first in our lives. Even when it\r\nis obvious that there are situations that are contending with our allegiance to Him, we\r\nmust be mindful of this instruction and resolve not to compromise our faith in God.\r\nAfter all, God made us, owns us and everything that belongs to us (Psalm 24:1). When\r\nwe violate this age-long ordinance, our progress may be hindered but when we obey\r\nand put Him first, He blesses us. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> What are the likely things that take first position in our lives apart from God? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\r\n        <li> What would you do if a sick relative of yours is in dire need of money, and the only\r\nmoney available with you is your first fruit? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\r\n       \r\n        <\/ol>\r\n\r\n        <\/li>\r\n\r\n <li>\r\n        \r\n        <h5> God's Concern for the Poor\r\nLeviticus 23:22 <\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> God's command to the people of Israel to bring their first fruits to the priests is closely\r\nrelated to caring for the poor (the deprived or disadvantaged) in their midst.\r\nAccording to the passage, God said to Moses, \"When you reap the harvest of your\r\nland, do not reap to the very edges of your field or gather the gleanings of your\r\nharvest.\" In other words, they were expected to intentionally leave some crops during\r\nharvest. This will serve as provision for the poor and the aliens, especially during the time of the celebration of God's abundance and provision. The warning became\r\nnecessary probably for two reasons: the tendency for the Israelites to take undue\r\nadvantage of poor people with the justification that they have given God their first fruits.\r\nSecondly, they may not be concerned about the underprivileged in their midst. This is\r\nexactly a clear indication of God's concern for the poor in the land of Israel. The same\r\norder was later given to the Israelites with the inclusion of widows and the fatherless so\r\nthat the work of their hands will be blessed by God (Deuteronomy 24:19). However, God\r\nwarned that the poor must be catered for and be allowed to gather the gleanings, as well\r\nas take from the leftovers at the edge of the farmland (Ruth 2:2-3). This was God's design\r\nfor meeting the needs of the poor in the land of Israel. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> The poor are the underprivileged people, who for some reasons cannot provide\r\nfor themselves and their family members. The poor are always around the people of\r\nGod (Deuteronomy 15:11). Just as God had concern for the poor and foreigners in the\r\ndays of Moses, today He expects believers to care for such people, especially those of\r\nthe household of faith, irrespective of where they come from (Galatians 5:6; 6:10), so\r\nthat none will be in want. This can be done through empowerment programmes,\r\nwhereby some of them are trained in various trades. Some influential members of the\r\nchurch can also use their stewardship of influence to help them whenever there are job\r\nopportunities. The church can also organise cooperative programmes from which members\r\ncan borrow with little or no interest for small scale businesses. When this is done, God's\r\nmandate would have been fulfilled and there will be joy and unity in the body of Christ. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> How can we truly identify the poor and needy, especially when there are\r\nprofessional beggars all around? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\r\n        <li> Are we not encouraging laziness if the church continues to care for people who are\r\nnot physically challenged? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\r\n      \r\n        <\/ol>\r\n\r\n        <\/li>\r\n\r\n        <\/ol>\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h4> Prayer Points <\/h4>\r\n        <ul>\r\n        <li> Thank God for the blessings you receive regularly from your work\/business. <\/li> <!-- Prayer Point 1-->\r\n        <li> Pray for grace to be sensitive to the needs of people around you. <\/li> <!-- Prayer Point 2-->\r\n        <li> Pray that God will break the yoke of poverty in your life <\/li> <!-- Prayer Point 3-->\r\n        <\/ul>\r\n\r\n             <h4> Fellowship and Ministry Building Activities <\/h4>\r\n        <ul>\r\n        <li> Identify poor mothers in the church and give them gifts e.g. foodstuffs, money, etc. <\/li> <!-- Fellowship Activity 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <\/ul>\r\n\r\n           <h4> Take Home <\/h4>\r\n        \r\n        <ul>\r\n        \r\n        <li> Christians should celebrate the blessings of God. <\/li> <!-- Take Home 1-->\r\n        <li> Giving is the hallmark of a Christian. <\/li> <!-- Take Home 2-->\r\n        <li> Self-centredness can hinder us from seeing the needs of the underprivileged. <\/li> <!-- Take Home 2-->\r\n        <li> The rich are blessed in order to care for the poor and needy. <\/li> <!-- Take Home 2-->\r\n        <\/ul><\/p>"},{"id":"20","title":"REMEMBERING WITH JOY","message":"<p><center>\r\n\r\n            <h4> May 20, 2018 <\/h4> <!--DATE-->\r\n            <h3> REMEMBERING WITH JOY <\/h3> <!--TOPIC-->\r\n\r\n        <p>\r\n        <p> Devotional Reading: Psalm 50:1-15 <\/p> <!--Devotional Reading Passage-->\r\n        <p> Background Scripture: Leviticus 25 <\/p> <!-- Background Scipture Passage-->\r\n        <p> Lesson Scripture: Leviticus 25:1-12 <\/p> <!-- Lesson Scipture Passage-->\r\n        <\/p>\r\n\r\n        <h4>Golden Text<\/h4>\r\n\r\n        <p> Consecrate the fiftieth year and proclaim liberty throughout\r\nthe land to all its inhabitants.

Before\r\nhis death, his slogan was \u201cI cannot afford\r\nto rest when there are business\r\nopportunities to be explored.\u201d In light of\r\nthis, he was always on the move without\r\nhaving enough time to rest. Apart from his\r\nbusiness philosophy, as a young man, he\r\nbelieved he must be hard-working, not\r\nminding the consequences. Truly, his\r\ndevotion to the success of his business was amazing even though it turned out to be a problem to his employees. He rarely\r\napproved leave for his employees because he was of the opinion that only lazy people\r\ngo on leave. His business grew so well as a result of his commitment but soon, his\r\nhealth deteriorated because of his rigorous working habit. He was later diagnosed of\r\ncardiac problem. Unfortunately, he died at the prime of his age.   <\/p>  <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n\r\n        <p> Today's lesson is a reminder of some of the commandments God gave to the\r\nchildren of Israel, through Moses. In Leviticus chapter 25, God commanded Moses to\r\ninstruct the Israelites to observe two specific feasts (the Sabbath and the year of\r\nJubilee) when they enter the Promised Land. While the Sabbath was a time for the land\r\nto lie fallow, the Jubilee was simply a time to proclaim liberty throughout the land to\r\nall the inhabitants. Particularly, the rest was to be observed at a stipulated time (the\r\nseventh farming year), which should be remembered with joy. However, these\r\ninstructions are not only meant for the nation of Israel. Contemporary Christians are\r\nexpected to take time to rest without being lazy or slothful. As much as rest is good for\r\nthe body, it is also good for the land because it enhances productivity. <\/p>  <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n\r\n        \r\n        <h4>THE LESSON EXPLAINED<\/h4>\r\n\r\n        <ol type=\"A\">\r\n\r\n        <li>\r\n        \r\n        <h5> The Command to Observe the Sabbath\r\nLeviticus 25:1-7 <\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> The book of Leviticus has a long list of God's commands through Moses to the\r\nIsraelites, especially concerning their relationship with Him. In chapter 25, God\r\ninstructed Moses on Mount Sinai to tell the Israelites to observe the Sabbath when\r\nthey eventually enter the Promised Land. Apart from the people, the land must also\r\nobserve the Sabbath to the Lord (v. 2). Invariably, when the children of Israel would\r\nhave tilled the land for six years, it should be allowed to rest, thereby preparing it for\r\nanother productive six years. In the seventh year, they are not expected to plant\r\nanything, prune their vineyards or harvest the crops and grapes that grow of itself (vv.\r\n4-5). It was emphasised that the Sabbath is not unto the people of Israel, but \u201ca\r\nSabbath to the LORD\u201d (v. 4), hence, it must be observed as a sacred year. However,\r\nwhatever the land would produce during the year would be enough for the people,\r\ntheir slaves and animals (vv. 6-7, 21). <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> There is a common saying that \"rest is sweet after labour\" and this rest is good\r\nfor humans, animals and land as it enhances productivity. After all, God rested after\r\nthe creation of the universe, thereby setting an example for us to follow (Genesis 2:2-\r\n3; Leviticus 23:3). The command to rest is necessary for all to observe because a\r\nperiod of rest for the people, the animals that plough and the servants who work on the\r\nfield is ultimately rewarding. Of course, God knew that His command not to cultivate\r\nthe land for one year will definitely lead to fear and doubts about their means of\r\nsurvival. Consequently, He assured the people that the land will still yield and its\r\nproduce will be enough for them, their animals and dependants (v. 6). Apparently, this\r\naffirms God's ability to care for His people since the earth and everything in it belongs to Him (Psalm 24:1; 50:10-11). This divine promise of provision (which was actually\r\nfulfilled) is also meant to awaken our trust in God's unfailing care for us both when we\r\nlabour and in time of legitimate rest. Those who fail to observe their annual leave\r\nbecause of their quest for more money also have a lesson to learn from this lest their\r\nhealth suffer a breakdown. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> What does \u201cthe land is God's\u201d (v. 23) mean to us today and how can we care for it?\r\nFrom professional practice, how does rest (fallowing) enhance productivity of\r\nlands? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\r\n        <li> Let some class members share their experiences of adequate rest in recent time. <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\r\n        \r\n        <\/ol>\r\n\r\n        <\/li>\r\n\r\n  <li>\r\n        \r\n        <h5> The Command to Observe Jubilee\r\nLeviticus 25:8-12 <\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> Jubilee was another important festival God instructed the people of Israel to celebrate.\r\nIt is also known as the year of restoration. According to verse 8, they were to count\r\nseven Sabbath years, which will make a total period of forty-nine years. Then on the\r\ntenth day of the seventh month, the trumpet would sound on the Day of Atonement\r\nthroughout the land. This date, which indicates the day the Israelites restored their\r\nrelationship with the Lord, with their sins atoned for (Leviticus 23:28), will be\r\nsucceeded by two other events: the consecration of the fiftieth year and the\r\nproclamation of liberty (the Year of Jubilee) all over the land including their\r\ninhabitants that dwell in the land. Accordingly, each of them will return to their\r\noriginal clan and family property. This is to ensure that poor people or slaves who have\r\nlost their properties (lands and\/or houses) can have them restored to them in the year of\r\nJubilee (vv. 23-31). It is also an indication that God abhors the amassing of wealth at\r\nthe expense of the poor. In addition, the people were instructed not to sow or harvest\r\nwhatever grows of itself in the field. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> The blowing of the trumpet in ancient Israel was remarkable. It signified a\r\nsolemn but joyful occasion which informs the people of an important event. The\r\nJubilee trumpet is to be sounded on the Day of Atonement, the tenth day in the seventh\r\nmonth. It suggests liberty and freedom for the people of Israel, giving them the\r\nopportunity to begin again. In fact, the feast was supposed to be celebrated and\r\nremembered with joy because of the cancellation of debts and slaves that would regain\r\ntheir freedom (Leviticus 25:39-41). Moreover, lands will be returned to their original\r\nowners and properties redeemed (Leviticus 23:25-28). Therefore, the Jubilee is an\r\nexpression of the grace of God, extended to humanity. It signifies the freedom that\r\nhumans are expected to enjoy having received atonement for their sins through the\r\nblood of Jesus Christ, thereby making our freedom total. Believers should, therefore, continue in the 'jubilee ministry' of Jesus Christ to grant freedom to the oppressed by\r\nministering to the prisoners, people living with disabilities, the poor (physical and\r\nspiritual) and the oppressed. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> Is the celebration of Jubilee still relevant?

They had\r\ntaught and trained their\r\nchildren, James and John, to trust God\r\nand give Him thanks in whatever\r\nsituation. As the children grew up, they\r\nstarted to demonstrate spiritual maturity\r\nto a point that their friends often\r\naddressed them as pastors. One day, the\r\nchildren were kidnapped by some gun\r\nmen on their way home from school.\r\nWhile they were in custody of their\r\nabductors, they were overwhelmed with fear and greatly disheartened, especially as they were being threatened with death\r\nevery day. Soon, the young men began to suspect some supposed enemies with whom\r\ntheir parents had had misunderstanding. But after some days in captivity without hope\r\nof being rescued, they realised that only God could set them free. Therefore, they\r\nresorted to singing praises and songs of deliverance to God and after twelve days in\r\ncaptivity, they were miraculously released without any ransom. When interviewed by\r\nsome journalists about the secret of their escape they simply said, \u201cWe trusted in the\r\nLord, He heard our prayers and delivered us from our enemies.\u201d In fact, their joy knew\r\nno bounds as they shared their testimonies in church about God's power to save and\r\ndeliver particularly in difficult moments. They promised to continue to trust in God\r\nand show Him gratitude, no matter the condition they find themselves.   <\/p>  <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n\r\n        <p> Today's lesson will focus on Psalm 34. It is a psalm of praise of God's goodness.\r\nThe psalm is believed to have been written by David in commemoration of his escape\r\nfrom Achish, the King of Gath, before whom he pretended to be mad in order to escape\r\ndeath (1Samuel 21:10-15). Interestingly, God hearkened to his prayer. His\r\nexperiences taught him that God has the power to rescue anyone from trouble,\r\nespecially when such an individual is righteous and trusts God. In his composition of\r\nthis psalm, David expressed that only the Lord can restore a man when faced with\r\noppositions and challenges of life. Whenever this restoration takes place, it is\r\nexpected of such an individual to joyfully ascribe the glory to God. <\/p>  <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n\r\n        \r\n        <h4>THE LESSON EXPLAINED<\/h4>\r\n\r\n        <ol type=\"A\">\r\n\r\n        <li>\r\n        \r\n        <h5> David's Personal Testimony\r\nPsalm 34:1-7 <\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> This psalm was composed by David when he was afraid that he might perish in Gath,\r\nby the sword of Achish. The psalm is a summary of his expression of gratitude to God\r\nfor deliverance and answer to prayer (v. 4) having escaped death. As a result, he\r\npublicly declared to always thank the Lord and never to stop praising Him for what He\r\nhad done (v. 1). Therefore, the afflicted and the poor who hear his testimony should\r\nglorify God with him (vv. 2-3), because he sought the Lord who answered him and\r\ndelivered him from all his fears. His declaration in verses 5 and 6 is astonishing. He\r\nsaid:\r\n        <\/p><ul>\r\n        <li> When the oppressed looked up to Him, they were glad and not disappointed. <\/li>\r\n        <li> The helpless called Him and He answered their prayers and saved them from\r\nall their troubles. Therefore, David acknowledged the fact that the angel of the\r\nLord always protects those who fear Him and delivers them from danger. <\/li>\r\n        <\/ul>\r\n          <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> David was a man of faith. In every trouble of his life, he learnt to talk to God in\r\nprayer, thanksgiving, praise and he testified to the faithfulness of God. He learnt to\r\ncommit his fears and worries about defeat and, death, which are capable of putting one\r\nin bondage, unto God. Unfortunately today, some Christians are overwhelmed with\r\nfear as a result of life's challenges. The only way to overcome such fear is to trust God for deliverance and give Him thanks always like David. Whenever we commit our\r\nfears and troubles unto the Lord in prayer, we are sure of deliverance and restoration.\r\nWhen we do contrary, we get unnecessarily anxious to the extent that we forget about\r\nGod's ability to deliver us from such unpleasant experiences. As mature believers, we\r\nshould learn from David, who spoke to God about his fears and testified of His\r\ndeliverance and restoration. This presupposes the fact that anyone who fears the Lord\r\nwill surely overcome. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> Discuss the effective ways a Christian can overcome fear. <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\r\n        <li> Why do believers easily complain and apportion blame when they are faced with\r\nlife's challenges? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\r\n      \r\n        <\/ol>\r\n\r\n        <\/li>\r\n\r\n<li>\r\n        \r\n        <h5> Encouragement to Seek Refuge in the Lord\r\nPsalm 34:8-10 <\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> David's testimony was followed by encouraging his readers to seek refuge in the Lord.\r\nFurthermore, he urged them to 'taste and see' which is the same as to 'find out' or to 'discover' the goodness of the Lord, especially to those who take refuge in Him (v. 8).\r\nThe admonition to fear the Lord is emphasised again in verse 9 when he said, \"Fear\r\nthe Lord, you his saints, for those who fear him lack nothing.\" The declaration was\r\nfurther explained when he said, even the young lions may grow weak and hungry,\r\nthose who fear God will lack no good thing (v. 10).  <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> David's counsel to seek protection in the Lord is encouraging. Without doubt,\r\nhe understood the importance of taking refuge in God based on his experiences in the\r\nwilderness when Saul sought to kill him (2 Kings 19:11-24). David was confident and\r\nexpressed the fact that the fear of God attracts His attention and a person who fears\r\nHim will not lack anything good (vv. 9-10). Based on his personal experiences in his\r\nwalk with God, David affirmed that the Lord redeems His servants; and no one who\r\ntakes refuge in Him will be forsaken (v. 22). David's admonition was that those who\r\nseek protection outside God should turn to Him and those who take refuge in the Lord\r\nshould be steadfast in Him. After all, other sources of refuge are man-made and will\r\nfail but God remains constant in His promises of safety for His people. Therefore, just\r\nas David encouraged his readers to taste and see the goodness of the Lord, believers\r\nare also encouraged to invite unbelievers around them to come out of darkness into the\r\nmarvellous light of God (Colossians 1:12-13). Our personal testimony can be a strong\r\nweapon for winning them to the Lord. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> Where do people seek refuge during turbulent times?

Invariably, Jesus has helped the descendants of\r\nAbraham. Christ became like His brothers and sisters that He might become their\r\nfaithful and merciful High Priest in His service to God, and in making atonement for\r\ntheir sins. Ultimately, He is most qualified to help those who are being tempted\r\nbecause He has been tempted and He also suffered through His death on the cross. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> Jesus Christ is the worthy High Priest whose death has brought eternal\r\nsalvation to humankind.

However, these high priests were not\r\nperfect in their ways; hence, the need to make an offering for their own sins first before\r\nmaking intercession for the people (Leviticus 16:8). Therefore, their ministry was\r\ndeficient (Hebrews 7:23). But Jesus is a worthy High Priest who has been \u201c... made\r\nlike his brothers in every way ...\u201d (v. 17). Automatically, we have become God's sons\r\nand daughters. Unlike the Old Testament high priests, Jesus did not sin when tempted\r\nand so He is able to express sympathy concerning our weaknesses (Hebrews 4:15).\r\nInstead, He overcame temptation and by this singular act, He understands and\r\nsympathises with our weaknesses, thereby making it possible for Him to make\r\nintercession for us in the presence of God (1 John 2:1-2). <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> What qualified Jesus and made Him able to help those who are being tempted? v. 18 <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\r\n        <li> State at least three differences between the Old Testament priests and Jesus, the\r\nHigh Priest <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\r\n        <li> What benefit do believers have since Jesus is the Great High\r\nPriest? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 3-->\r\n        <\/ol>\r\n\r\n        <\/li>\r\n        \r\n        <\/ol>\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h4> Prayer Points <\/h4>\r\n        <ul>\r\n        <li> Lord, forgive me for my lack of trust in You, in time past. <\/li> <!-- Prayer Point 1-->\r\n        <li> Father, help me to commit my fears to You and trust You as my Refuge and\r\nDeliverer. <\/li> <!-- Prayer Point 2-->\r\n        \r\n        <\/ul>\r\n\r\n             <h4> Fellowship and Ministry Building Activities <\/h4>\r\n        <ul>\r\n        <li> Make a list of at least five things you can thank God for in the last few months and\r\nfive things to thank God for in the lives of the children around you. <\/li> <!-- Fellowship Activity 1-->\r\n        <li> Compose a song of thanksgiving to God for His faithfulness and teach it to others \u2013\r\npossibly children.

However, it has been\r\nobserved that enforcing the law has\r\nbrought pain and sorrow to the general public. On one occasion, a pregnant woman in labour was denied movement to the\r\nhospital for breaking the law of the State. The woman who was in serious pains was\r\nleft unattended to for several hours until the intervention of a higher security officer\r\nwho permitted the husband to quickly take the woman to the hospital to save her life\r\nand that of her unborn child. The law enforcement officers were only interested in\r\nenforcing the law of the State without considering the dangerous state of the pregnant\r\nwoman. What is your judgment about their action? To what extent is their action\r\njustifiable? <\/p>  <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n\r\n        <p> The question about strict observance of the Sabbath was one of the disputes\r\nbetween Jesus and the Pharisees as recorded in Chapter 12 of the gospel of Matthew.\r\nThe Old Testament had strict laws about the observance of the Sabbath for the\r\nchildren of Israel. In the book of Deuteronomy, God told the people that they were free\r\nto eat the grapes in someone else's vineyard but none should be taken away. Also, they\r\nare free to eat the corn that are plucked by hand and not with a sickle (Deuteronomy\r\n23:24-25). Unfortunately, the Jewish tradition added other restrictions to these laws\r\nto the point that it eventually voided God's original purpose of commanding that the\r\nSabbath day be kept holy (Exodus 20:10). Today's lesson focuses on the argument that\r\nensued between Jesus and the Pharisees over the observance of the Sabbath with\r\nregards to Jesus' disciples who plucked some ears of corn from a field when they were\r\nhungry. In His response, Jesus affirmed that the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath. <\/p>  <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n\r\n        \r\n        <h4>THE LESSON EXPLAINED<\/h4>\r\n\r\n        <ol type=\"A\">\r\n\r\n        <li>\r\n        \r\n        <h5> Jesus Accused of Breaking the Law of the Sabbath\r\nMatthew 12:1-8 <\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> Jesus and His disciples travelled through a particular grain field on a Sabbath, in the\r\ncourse of proclaiming the Gospel. Most likely because of the long journey, the\r\ndisciples became hungry and began to pluck some heads of grain and eat them. But the\r\naction displeased the Pharisees. They assumed that the disciples had broken the Law\r\nof Moses, which forbids reaping on the Sabbath. They said to Jesus, \"Look! Your\r\ndisciples are doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath.\" (v. 2) In His response to counter\r\ntheir accusation, Jesus cited two examples: firstly, He made reference to David and\r\nhis companions who ate the bread offered to God which ought to be eaten only by the\r\npriests (1 Samuel 21:1-6; Leviticus 24:5-9). Secondly, the priests in the Temple who\r\nbroke the Sabbath law by desecrating the day and yet were not guilty. He made them\r\nrealise in verse 6 that the kingdom of heaven is far more important than the temple\r\nrituals. In other words, what He desires is kindness and not animal sacrifices.\r\nTherefore, no one should be condemned, especially those who are not guilty after all.\r\nJesus' rhetorical questions meant that the disciples were not guilty of any offence\r\nbecause He knows how best the laws of the Sabbath should be kept. His quotation of\r\nHosea 6:6 is an indirect way of reinterpreting the law of the Sabbath for the Pharisees.\r\nTheir understanding that God desires mercy above sacrifice and that the Son of Man (Jesus) is Lord of the Sabbath are key elements of this reinterpretation (vv. 7, 8). <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> It should be noted that the disciples of Jesus were not really accused of stealing\r\ngrains even though they took them from a field that was not theirs. The reason is that\r\nthe Law of Moses permitted the plucking of grains from a neighbour's field as long as\r\nit was done by hand and not with a sickle (Deuteronomy 23:25). According to the\r\nPharisees, they were apparently guilty of reaping (harvesting the grains) on the\r\nSabbath, thereby contravening the Law of Moses. However, since Jesus and His\r\ndisciples are greater than the Temple (v. 6), He automatically has the authority to\r\noverride the normal Sabbath regulations. In essence, Jesus established that biblical\r\nprinciples should have preference over ritual observances (Hosea 6:6). Customs and\r\ntraditions, no matter how spiritual they seem should not hinder believers from doing\r\ngood or meeting the needs of other people. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> Discuss some traditions in our churches today that can be regarded as rituals. <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\r\n        <li> Jesus said, \u201cfor the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.\u201d Discuss. <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\r\n       \r\n        <\/ol>\r\n\r\n        <\/li>\r\n\r\n  <li>\r\n        \r\n        <h5> Jesus Accused of Healing on a Sabbath\r\nMatthew 12:9-12 <\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> When Jesus left the Pharisees, He went straight into the synagogue as it was His habit\r\nand there, He met a man who had a shrivelled hand. There, a group of people\r\n(probably the same group of Pharisees) asked Him, \"Is it lawful to heal on the\r\nSabbath?\" It is obvious that they were looking for a reason to accuse Jesus again of\r\nbreaking the Sabbath, since the Pharisees claimed it was a sin to heal on the sabbath.\r\nJesus, however, justified his action through an illustration that if they could lift out\r\ntheir sheep when it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, they should know that a person's life\r\nis much more valuable than that of a sheep; therefore, it is lawful to do good and heal a\r\nsick person on the Sabbath. In the gospel of Luke, Jesus also defended the healing of a\r\nman with dropsy on the Sabbath. He, however, made it difficult for them to protest by\r\nposing a rhetorical question that left them speechless: 'If one of you has a child or an\r\nox that falls into a well on the Sabbath day, will you not immediately pull it out?'\r\n(Luke 14:1-6). <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> The Pharisees, and the teachers of the law were fond of accusing Jesus,\r\nespecially in relation to the violation of the Mosaic law. However, Jesus did not plan\r\nto abolish the law, rather He gave it its full meaning. The fact is that He only\r\ncondemned the hypocritical lifestyle of the Pharisees who were only concerned about\r\nstrict observance without fair dealings. The implication for believers is that we should\r\nbalance our understanding of observance of the law and justice. If the keeping of any\r\nlaw will cause us to ill-treat people, we should know that it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath. We should also ask for God's wisdom to make us do what is right. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> Is the command to observe the Sabbath still relevant to contemporary Christians? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\r\n        <li> Discuss some funny questions unbelievers ask with the intention of ridiculing\r\nJesus and His followers and how to handle such situations. <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\r\n       \r\n        <\/ol>\r\n\r\n        <\/li>\r\n\r\n  <li>\r\n        \r\n        <h5> Jesus' Healing Power Manifested\r\nMatthew 12:13-14 <\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> The ministry of Jesus waxed stronger in the face of oppositions. Having declared that\r\nit is lawful to do good on the Sabbath (v. 12), Jesus commanded the man with\r\nshrivelled hand saying, \"Stretch out your hand\" and because the man obeyed, his\r\nhand was completely restored just like the other (v. 13). Instead of the Pharisees to\r\nrejoice over the healing miracle, they went out and plotted how they might kill Jesus.\r\nTo these hard-hearted people, a common deed of kindness on the Sabbath was a\r\ncrime, which deserves death. The Pharisees generally believed that acts of mercy\r\nwere allowed only on the Sabbath if the life of the sick person was in danger.\r\nHowever, it is obvious that the life of this man was not in danger thus the healing of\r\nthe man so infuriated them that they planned to kill Jesus. This incident is also\r\nmentioned in Mark 3:1-6 and Luke 6:6-11. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> Even today, there are traditions in some churches that have made it difficult for\r\npeople to render help to those in need and the result is friction and division among\r\nGod's people. Instead of such people to allow the Spirit of God to direct them, they\r\nsimply hold on to such traditions\/protocol and allow people to suffer unnecessarily.\r\nTherefore, Christians must be mindful and allow the Spirit of God to lead them as\r\nthey consider situations in which they can set aside traditions for the sake of showing\r\ncompassion, according to Jesus' explanation. Since Sabbath is a day of rest, believers\r\nshould pay attention to every effort or act that will foster rest and deliverance from\r\nsin, sickness, unemployment, poverty and the like. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> Discuss the implication of Jesus\\' healing miracle on the Sabbath in this passage\r\nand how this affects believers of today. <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\r\n        <li> Discuss ways Christians can handle unnecessary criticism. <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\r\n        \r\n        <\/ol>\r\n\r\n        <\/li>\r\n        \r\n        <\/ol>\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h4> Prayer Points <\/h4>\r\n        <ul>\r\n        <li> Help me, Lord, to identify some customs and rituals that have hindered me from\r\nshowing compassion to the needy. <\/li> <!-- Prayer Point 1-->\r\n        <li> Teach me the best way to observe the Sabbath without ignoring its real meaning. <\/li> <!-- Prayer Point 2-->\r\n        <li> Forgive me where I have considered temple rituals more important than acts of\r\nkindness. <\/li> <!-- Prayer Point 3-->\r\n        <\/ul>\r\n\r\n             <h4> Fellowship and Ministry Building Activities <\/h4>\r\n        <ul>\r\n        <li> Read Romans 14:5-6 and Colossians 2:16, and discuss the implications of these\r\nverses on Christians' observance of the Sabbath. <\/li> <!-- Fellowship Activity 1-->\r\n       \r\n        <\/ul>\r\n\r\n           <h4> Take Home <\/h4>\r\n        \r\n        <ul>\r\n        \r\n        <li> Believers should endeavour to set aside some rules in order to help those in need. <\/li> <!-- Take Home 1-->\r\n        <li> Christians should be ready to show compassion rather than mere compliance to\r\nrituals <\/li> <!-- Take Home 2-->\r\n        <li> Jesus is truly the Lord of the Sabbath. <\/li> <!-- Take Home 2-->\r\n        <li> Believers should be cautious of what they say and who they criticise. <\/li> <!-- Take Home 2-->\r\n        <\/ul><\/p>"},{"id":"23","title":"PARABLES OF GOD\\'S JUST KINGDOM","message":"<p><center>\r\n\r\n            <h4> June 10, 2018 <\/h4> <!--DATE-->\r\n            <h3> PARABLES OF GOD'S JUST KINGDOM <\/h3> <!--TOPIC-->\r\n\r\n        <p>\r\n        <p> Devotional Reading: Psalm 78:1-8 <\/p> <!--Devotional Reading Passage-->\r\n        <p> Background Scripture: Matthew 13:24-43 <\/p> <!-- Background Scipture Passage-->\r\n        <p> Lesson Scripture: Matthew 13:24-33 <\/p> <!-- Lesson Scipture Passage-->\r\n        <\/p>\r\n\r\n        <h4>Golden Text<\/h4>\r\n\r\n        <p> Let both grow together until the harvest.

Jesus Christ, the Great Teacher, taught His people\r\ndifferent parables about the kingdom of God. He spoke in parables because of the\r\nspiritual dullness of the people (Matthew 13:10-15; Luke 8:4), and to fulfil the\r\nprophecy of Prophet Isaiah which says, \"I will use parables when I speak to them; I\r\nwill tell them things unknown since the creation of the world\" (v. 14).

The field is the world, the good seed sown are people of the kingdom,\r\nthe weeds are people of the world, and the enemy who sowed the weeds is the Devil. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> The implication of this parable is that believers are kingdom people and are bound\r\nto live in this world with sinners and wicked people. However, we must live as citizens\r\nof heaven in the kingdom of this world, sprouting as good seeds with godly fruit of\r\nrighteousness (1 John 2:15-17). Just as the wheat and weeds were distinct in their\r\nappearance, the world should be able to identify Christians by their fruits, which\r\nshould be void of hypocrisy. We must ask for the grace to co-exist with evil in the\r\nworld, especially in our immediate society and workplace while we maintain the\r\ngoodness of the godly nature in us without being contaminated or corrupted in the\r\nworld. Applying this grace must also be done with the understanding that our chief\r\nenemy who placed the weeds around us is the Devil. We must, therefore, resist him so\r\nthat he will flee from us. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> How can we identify genuine Christians and hypocritical people or wicked ones\r\naround us? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\r\n        <li> Discuss some of the ways the Devil deceives and destroys God's good plans and purposes for His people today and how to avoid such strategies. <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\r\n        \r\n        <\/ol>\r\n\r\n        <\/li>\r\n\r\n<li>\r\n        \r\n        <h5> The Harvest of Weeds and the Wheat\r\nMatthew 13:27-30 <\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> According to verse 27, the servants were shocked at the appearance of the weeds\r\namong the wheat and out of curiosity asked the master, \"Sir, didn't you sow good seed\r\nin your field? Where then did the weeds come from?' The good seeds represent the\r\nrighteous and the weeds are the evil or unrighteous people planted mischievously by\r\nthe Devil. Obviously, the weed planted among the wheat was the handiwork of the\r\nenemy to destroy the good work of the owner of the field. The servant immediately\r\nsought permission to pull out the weeds but the master would rather allow both to\r\ngrow to full maturity before separation. The reason for his decision was the fear of\r\nmistakenly uprooting the wheat alongside the weed. Then, while the weeds are tied in\r\nbundles to be burned, the wheat will be gathered for storage (v. 30). <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> This parable is meant to teach that the 'children of the evil one', which symbolise\r\nthe weeds are destined for damnation with no opportunity to change their destiny. The\r\nphrase \u201cwhile everyone else was asleep,'' shows the determination of the enemy to\r\nfrustrate the good plans and purpose of God for His people. Though the wheat and\r\nweeds would be allowed to grow together in the same field and under the same\r\nweather condition, they would not have equal fate. Ultimately while the weeds would\r\nbe gathered in bundles and be burnt, the wheat would be stored safely in the barn for\r\nfuture use. The harvest refers to the end of age, which will be executed by angels\r\n(harvesters).

As He continued in His teaching, He used different analogies to\r\nillustrate and drive home His point for the sake of clarity. As it is seen in the passage, He told them another parable. Just like the parable of the weeds, Jesus likened the\r\nkingdom of heaven to a man who planted a mustard seed in his field. The mustard\r\nseed, according to verse 32, is the smallest of all seeds but it usually turns out to be the\r\nbiggest of all plants that its branches accommodate the birds of the air. Furthermore,\r\nJesus described the kingdom of heaven and likened it to a woman who mixes some\r\nquantity of yeast until the whole dough of flour rises (v. 33). The ancient equivalent of\r\nyeast was a lump of leavened dough saved from the previous baking of bread\r\nwhereby a small quantity will easily make a large quantity of flour rise. Though the\r\nword yeast in the Scripture is most times used to mean corruption or evil that pervades\r\nthe whole, it here represents the secret way the kingdom of God will spread. Jesus was\r\nparticularly interested in making people understand the nature of His kingdom and\r\nwhat it takes to enter into it. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> Some people, however, believe that these parables teach about the combination of\r\nthe evil and righteousness in the church while others see it as a vivid image of the\r\nstartling growth and spread of God's kingdom. However, it is certain that this parable\r\nexplains the small beginning of Christ's kingdom, its gradual and unnoticeable\r\ngrowth in the individual and eventually the transforming power of the Gospel in\r\nindividual lives and nations, which is God's purpose and plan for the church. Even\r\nthough the spread of the Gospel may seem slow, it will definitely spread through the\r\nworld. In addition, the reference to birds perching on the tree may indicate that people of\r\ndifferent social, ethnic, racial, economic and religious backgrounds will find rest in it. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> What truth do these parables reveal about the kingdom of God? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\r\n        <li> Discuss some hindrances to the spread of the Gospel and the roles of the Church in\r\nthe spread of the Gospel. <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\r\n        <li> Describe the different ways Christians can influence their communities for the\r\nsake of spreading the gospel message to unbelievers. <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 3-->\r\n        <\/ol>\r\n\r\n        <\/li>\r\n        \r\n        <\/ol>\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h4> Prayer Points <\/h4>\r\n        <ul>\r\n        <li>  <\/li> <!-- Prayer Point 1-->\r\n        <li> <\/li> <!-- Prayer Point 2-->\r\n        <li> <\/li> <!-- Prayer Point 3-->\r\n        <\/ul>\r\n\r\n             <h4> Fellowship and Ministry Building Activities <\/h4>\r\n        <ul>\r\n        <li> <\/li> <!-- Fellowship Activity 1-->\r\n        <li> <\/li> <!-- Fellowship Activity 2-->\r\n        <\/ul>\r\n\r\n           <h4> Take Home <\/h4>\r\n        \r\n        <ul>\r\n        \r\n        <li> <\/li> <!-- Take Home 1-->\r\n        <li> <\/li> <!-- Take Home 2-->\r\n        \r\n        <\/ul><\/p>"},{"id":"24","title":"JESUS TEACHES ABOUT JUSTICE","message":"<p><center>\r\n\r\n            <h4> June 17, 2018 <\/h4> <!--DATE-->\r\n            <h3> JESUS TEACHES ABOUT JUSTICE <\/h3> <!--TOPIC-->\r\n\r\n        <p>\r\n        <p> Devotional Reading: Mark 7:1-13 <\/p> <!--Devotional Reading Passage-->\r\n        <p> Background Scripture: Matthew 15:1-9; Mark 7:1-13 <\/p> <!-- Background Scipture Passage-->\r\n        <p> Lesson Scripture: Matthew 15:1-9 <\/p> <!-- Lesson Scipture Passage-->\r\n        <\/p>\r\n\r\n        <h4>Golden Text<\/h4>\r\n\r\n        <p> \"'These people honour me with their lips,\r\nbut their hearts are far from me.\r\n<b>Matthew 15:8<\/b> <\/p> <!-- Golden Text; Make Sure the scripture passage is made bold-->\r\n\r\n<\/center>\r\n\r\n        <h4>Objectives :<\/h4>\r\n        <p>By the end of the lesson, class members should be able to:<\/p>\r\n\r\n        <ul>\r\n        <li> Describe some ways people break the\r\nlaws of God for selfish reasons. <\/li>   <!-- Objective 1-->\r\n        <li> Identify some principles that should\r\nguide Christians in observing the\r\nlaw <\/li>   <!-- Objective 2-->\r\n        <li> Verbally appreciate the superiority of\r\nChrist over all. <\/li>   <!-- Objective 3-->\r\n        <\/ul>\r\n\r\n        <h4>INTRODUCTION<\/h4>\r\n        <p> \"Papa judge\", as he was fondly\r\ncalled, was a prominent and retired\r\njudge.

It was another Christmas holiday\r\nand 'papa judge' hosted his\r\ngrandchildren. Every day after breakfast,\r\npapa would go to the library with his\r\ngrandson, Peter. One day, out of\r\ncuriosity, Peter asked his grandfather the\r\nreason for his interest in reading when heno longer goes to court. With a smile on his face, 'papa judge' nodded his head and\r\nexplained that he needed to read widely so that he could interpret the laws of the land\r\ncorrectly which have been violated and misinterpreted in different cases. He further\r\nexplained that laws, as good as they seem, can be misinterpreted and applied wrongly. <\/p>  <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n\r\n        <p> The rulers at Jerusalem had already determined in their hearts to kill Jesus\r\nprobably because of His popularity in Galilee and, therefore, sent a delegation of\r\nPharisees to condemn whatever Jesus did and make Him and His teachings\r\nunacceptable to the people. The practice of hand washing that is referred to in this\r\npassage was purely a religious ceremony. However, Jesus made them realise that such\r\nceremonial cleansing has no connection with defilement for real defilement is of the\r\nheart. He denounced them for violating the Word of God by some of their traditions of\r\nhuman origin (v. 6). <\/p>  <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n\r\n        \r\n        <h4>THE LESSON EXPLAINED<\/h4>\r\n\r\n        <ol type=\"A\">\r\n\r\n        <li>\r\n        \r\n        <h5> The Pharisees Accused Jesus\r\nMatthew 15:1-2 <\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> The story in the passage is another controversy with the religious leaders in which the\r\nbehaviour of Jesus' disciples contrasted the tradition of the Jews who believed in the\r\nwashing of hands before each meal for the purpose of purity. Jesus had just walked on\r\nwater and had become more popular because of the healing miracles He performed\r\n(Matthew 14:34-36). Unfortunately, some Pharisees and teachers of the law who had\r\nheard of the great miracles came from Jerusalem and asked Jesus a question\r\nconcerning their old tradition. They said, \u201cWhy do your disciples break the tradition\r\nof the elders? They don't wash their hands before they eat\u201d (v. 2). The Pharisees\r\nquestioned the reason Jesus would approve of such behaviour, when He knew that the\r\nlaw forbade it. The Pharisees were a powerful sect that took pride in their strict\r\nobservance of the Law of Moses and, therefore, compelled others to do same without\r\ndue consideration for justice. It is not unlikely that they were always on the lookout\r\nfor Jesus and His disciples to identify the next tradition or rules they would break.\r\nThey had constituted themselves an opposition party and from time to time, they\r\nmonitored Jesus and His disciples looking for an opportunity to accuse Him. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> According to the passage, the Pharisees hinged their argument on the tradition of\r\nelders. The practice of the washing of hands before each meal was a prescribed\r\nreligious rite, which is assumed to make a person ritually clean (v. 20) and not just a\r\nmatter of hygiene. Similarly, there are some church rules and traditions that some\r\nbelievers take pride in because observing them makes them feel more spiritual than\r\nothers. Their 'spiritual arrogance' often reflect in the way they belittle or condemn those\r\nwho do not live up to their own man-made standards. These often lead to incorrect\r\ninterpretations of the Scripture such that priority is placed on following rules and\r\nregulations of men without due attention to the issues of the heart. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> Why do some Christians demonstrate their knowledge of God's Word in an\r\narrogant and critical manner? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\r\n        <li> Some Christians misinterpret Gods Word purposely to suit their situation.

He questioned their disobedience to God's command when He said, 'Honour your father and mother\u201d and \u201canyone who curses his father or mother must\r\nbe put to death\" __ a reference to two Old Testament passages (Exodus 20:12;\r\nDeuteronomy 5:16). Surprisingly, these religious leaders taught that anything\r\ndedicated to God's service was sacred and could not be used for any other purpose,\r\neven to honour one's parents. According to Jesus, such behaviour is equated with\r\ndisregard to God's command in order to follow their own teaching. In other words, the\r\naction of the disciples of not washing their hands before meal had not in any way\r\ndefiled them despite what the Pharisees taught and believed. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> The commandment to honour one's father and mother is repeated by Jesus in His\r\nresponse to the question of the rich young ruler (Matthew 19:19). It was also\r\nemphasised in Paul's letter to the brethren in Ephesus in his effort to promote family\r\nrelationship (Ephesians 6:2). Even though the Pharisees were strict in observing the\r\nlaw, Jesus categorically rejected the practice of using an aspect of the Bible to nullify\r\nanother. Even today, there are some traditions or rules that have been adopted by some\r\nchurches but are not scriptural and unfortunately, such traditions have become\r\nhindrances to true followers of Jesus. But in His explanation, Jesus endorsed care for\r\none's parents as an important aspect of justice and mercy. The major lesson for\r\nbelievers in this passage is that we should not be tempted to comply with traditions\r\nthat are not scriptural or helpful in any way. Instead, we should balance our obedience\r\nto religious traditions with compliance to biblical laws. Any tradition that makes us to\r\nneglect or nullify another biblical responsibility should be revisited and reviewed for\r\nholistic compliance with the Scriptures, the ultimate standard for Christian living and\r\npractice. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> To what extent should Christians keep the law and at the same time show mercy\r\nand promote justice? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\r\n        <li> It seems there is a decline in the old practice of honouring one's parents.

Having rebuked them for disobeying God's\r\nWord for the sake of their tradition, He made them realise the implication of\r\nmisinterpreting the law with regard to caring for their parents. Jesus, therefore,\r\nreferred to the Pharisees as hypocrites according to Isaiah's prophecy. Their\r\nhypocrisy is seen in honouring God with their lips and not with their hearts.\r\nConsequently, their worship is in vain and made up of rules taught by men (Isaiah 29:13). <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> In His conclusion about the practice of hand washing before meal, Jesus\r\ncondemned the act absolutely because it was a doctrine taught by men. According to\r\nthe New International Version (NIV) Study Bible, after the Babylonian captivity\r\nexperience, the Jewish rabbis started to make detailed rules and regulations that\r\nconstituted the interpretation of the Law of Moses that would guide the people. The\r\nlaws were handed down from one generation to another but Jesus never hesitated to\r\ndenounce such laws and age-long tradition whenever it undermined scriptural principles.\r\nHe often explained that keeping the law without the Holy Spirit, who gives spiritual\r\nunderstanding, is vain. Similarly, because of our desire to be more faithful to God in our\r\nservice, Christians should endeavour to maintain God's standard instead of adhering to\r\nsome traditions that are constituted and taught by men. The implication is that such\r\ntraditions can serve as a barrier to the spiritual growth of the individual and the church of\r\nGod at large. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> Ask a church member to recall a change that the church made in the past and how it\r\nhas affected the growth of the church and the entire members. <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\r\n        <li> Discuss what lip service means as it is used in the passage. <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\r\n       \r\n        <\/ol>\r\n\r\n        <\/li>\r\n\r\n        <\/ol>\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h4> Prayer Points <\/h4>\r\n        <ul>\r\n        <li> Help me, O God, not to be associated with those who break Your laws. <\/li> <!-- Prayer Point 1-->\r\n        <li> Remove from me every form of hypocritical lifestyle so that I will not be a\r\nhindrance to the spread of the Gospel. <\/li> <!-- Prayer Point 2-->\r\n        <li> I receive grace to always worship you in spirit and in truth. <\/li> <!-- Prayer Point 3-->\r\n        <\/ul>\r\n\r\n             <h4> Fellowship and Ministry Building Activities <\/h4>\r\n        <ul>\r\n        <li> Let each class member list some inimical church traditions and brainstorm on how such traditions can be reversed for the purpose of growing the church. <\/li> <!-- Fellowship Activity 1-->\r\n       \r\n        <\/ul>\r\n\r\n           <h4> Take Home <\/h4>\r\n        \r\n        <ul>\r\n        \r\n        <li> When we misinterpret the Bible, we misrepresent God. <\/li> <!-- Take Home 1-->\r\n        <li> True religion is showing God's justice and mercy at the same time. <\/li> <!-- Take Home 2-->\r\n        <li> Christians should endeavour to balance their compliance to church rituals with\r\nseeking justice for others. <\/li> <!-- Take Home 2-->\r\n         <li> Believers should seek to obey God's commandments out of a heartfelt devotion\r\nand not just mere acts of observance. <\/li> <!-- Take Home 2-->\r\n        <\/ul><\/p>"},{"id":"25","title":"REAPING GOD'S JUSTICE ","message":"<p><center>\r\n\r\n            <h4> June 24, 2018 <\/h4> <!--DATE-->\r\n            <h3> REAPING GOD'S JUSTICE <\/h3> <!--TOPIC-->\r\n\r\n        <p>\r\n        <p> Devotional Reading: Luke 6:20-26 <\/p> <!--Devotional Reading Passage-->\r\n        <p> Background Scripture: Luke 16:19-31; John 5:24-30 <\/p> <!-- Background Scipture Passage-->\r\n        <p> Lesson Scripture: Luke 16:19-31 <\/p> <!-- Lesson Scipture Passage-->\r\n        <\/p>\r\n\r\n        <h4>Golden Text<\/h4>\r\n\r\n        <p> \"But Abraham replied, 'Son, remember that in your lifetime you received your\r\ngood things, while Lazarus received bad things, but now he is comforted here and\r\nyou are in agony.\r\n<b>Luke 16:25<\/b> <\/p> <!-- Golden Text; Make Sure the scripture passage is made bold-->\r\n\r\n<\/center>\r\n\r\n        <h4>Objectives :<\/h4>\r\n        <p>By the end of the lesson, class members should be able to:<\/p>\r\n\r\n        <ul>\r\n        <li> Compare and contrast the life of\r\nLazarus and the rich man while on\r\nearth and in eternity. <\/li>   <!-- Objective 1-->\r\n        <li> Discuss the implication of depending\r\non material things at the detriment of\r\nthe salvation of our souls. <\/li>   <!-- Objective 2-->\r\n        <li> Make a verbal\/written commitment\r\nto be faithful stewards of all their\r\npossessions. <\/li>   <!-- Objective 3-->\r\n        <\/ul>\r\n\r\n        <h4>INTRODUCTION<\/h4>\r\n        <p> Sister Favour Asabor is passionate\r\nabout the salvation of lost souls.\r\nShe goes out on personal\r\nevangelism from time to time despite\r\nher busy schedule at school.

In contrast, Lazarus was a\r\nbeggar who suffered from poor health and hunger thus he always sat at the gate of the\r\nrich man waiting for an opportunity to eat the crumbs from his table. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> Lazarus might have been abandoned by friends and family members.\r\nConsequently, he decided to stay at the gate of the rich man with the hope that he\r\nwould get help. He longed to feed on the crumbs that fell from the table of the rich man\r\nwho definitely had more than enough to eat and cater for others. Unfortunately for\r\nLazarus, the crumbs became food for dogs. Instead of the rich man to use his God-\r\ngiven resources to bless the poor, he was indifferent. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> It is possible that Lazarus' ill-health occasioned his poverty.

A time came when both the rich man\r\nand Lazarus died but their destinations after death were different. Apparently, the rich\r\nman would have been buried amid pomp and pageantry, tributes and praises, while Lazarus' death would have gone unnoticed and uncelebrated as no reference was\r\nmade to his burial except that he was carried by angels to Abraham's bosom. In other\r\nwords, Lazarus was given a place of honour and exaltation next to Abraham in\r\nparadise where the righteous are kept till the final judgment. While in great torment in\r\nhell, the rich man saw Lazarus in Abraham's bosom. He was surprised and so he cried\r\nout with a loud voice, 'Father Abraham, have pity on me and send Lazarus to dip the\r\ntip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, because I am in agony in this fire.' (v. 24)\r\nUnfortunately, Abraham's reply was not favourable to the rich man; he reminded him\r\nof the contrast between the life of luxury and poverty they both lived while on earth.\r\nThe passage shows the remarkable difference in destinations and experiences after\r\ndeath. For example:\r\n        <\/p><ul>\r\n        <li> The rich man was in hell where he was tormented but Lazarus was comforted in\r\nthe bosom of Abraham. There will be torment in hell for sinners, and comfort in\r\nheaven for the redeemed. <\/li>\r\n        <li> The rich man lived in isolation but Lazarus had companion. <\/li>\r\n        <li> The agony of the blazing heat of hell made the rich man beg for a drop of water\r\nbut Lazarus was comfortable. <\/li>\r\n        <li> The rich man regretted his self-indulgence and self-centredness but Lazarus had\r\nno regrets from his previous life. <\/li>\r\n        <li> The rich man was trapped in hell with no opportunity of escape, mercy or leniency\r\nwhile Lazarus was happily received by Father Abraham. Little wonder the author\r\nof the book of James emphasised the fate of the rich when they fail to treat the\r\npoor around them justly (James 5:1ff). He, thereafter, warned them to repent and\r\nweep because of the coming misery. <\/li>\r\n        <\/ul>\r\n  <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> The reality of hell should make saints and sinners alike fear God and live in the\r\nconsciousness of judgement after death.

Consequently, he shifted his attention from what could give him comfort and\r\nexpressed fear about the fate of his brothers. He passionately begged Abraham to\r\nsend Lazarus back to the earth to warn his five brothers that hell is real so that they can\r\nrepent while they are still alive and thereby escape the torment of hell (vv. 28, 30). Of\r\ncourse, his request showed his ignorance of the fact that the dead cannot do anything\r\nto help those who are alive. Abraham responded that the rich man's brothers could\r\navoid the danger of hell if they live by the Law of Moses and the Prophets (v. 29). The\r\nphrase 'Moses and the Prophets' refer to the Law of Moses and the preachers.\r\nNevertheless, the rich man persisted and reasoned that if someone were to rise from\r\nthe dead and go to them, they would turn from their sins but Abraham told him that\r\nproofs from a dead person would still not convince them if the preaching of God\u2019s\r\nword would not bring about a change in them. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> From the passage, we can see that the rich man, when he found himself in hell,\r\nregretted his indifference to the plight of Lazarus and failure to prepare for eternity in\r\nheaven while on earth. James 5 also corroborates the unpalatable fate of the rich when\r\nthey fail to treat the poor around them justly. Therefore, the challenge from this lesson\r\nis that believers should respond with compassion to the needs of the poor in their\r\nchurches, families and communities and be ready to live by the truth and standard of\r\nGod's Word. We should emulate the early church in which the brethren were together\r\nand had everything in common. (Acts 2:42-47). However, it should be noted that God\r\nis not interested in the death of any sinner but His desire is that all will come to\r\nrepentance and be saved (2 Peter 3:9). <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> Discuss how believers can save the souls of their loved ones and others like the\r\nrich man desired in today's passage. <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\r\n        <li> What other lessons can we draw from the life of the rich man in today\u2019s lesson? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\r\n        <li> Discuss the importance of social ministry in the church. <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 3-->\r\n        <\/ol>\r\n\r\n        <\/li>\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h4> Prayer Points <\/h4>\r\n        <ul>\r\n        <li> Thank God for His daily provision for you and members of your family. <\/li> <!-- Prayer Point 1-->\r\n        <li> Pray that God will bless you so that you will be able to meet the needs of people\r\naround you, no matter how little your income is. <\/li> <!-- Prayer Point 2-->\r\n        <li> Pray that God will deal with the problem of selfishness, greed and poverty in our\r\nchurches. <\/li> <!-- Prayer Point 3-->\r\n        <\/ul>\r\n\r\n             <h4> Fellowship and Ministry Building Activities <\/h4>\r\n        <ul>\r\n        <li> Class members should compile the needs of the poor in the church\/community and\r\ndiscuss how these needs can be met.

A story was once\r\ntold of a man who, as a result of careless\r\ndriving, crashed into someone else's\r\nvehicle and damaged the rear window.\r\nThe owner of the vehicle who introduced\r\nhimself as a Senior Advocate of Nigeria\r\n(SAN) pardoned him having begged for\r\nforgiveness. Unfortunately, the same man refused to forgive an okada rider who broke his side mirror some days later.\r\nDespite the man's plea for forgiveness, he insisted that the mirror should be replaced\r\nwith the option of reporting the case to the police. The man eventually paid for the\r\nreplacement of the side mirror before he released him but while he was going, a voice\r\nspoke and reminded him of his experience few days back and how he obtained mercy.\r\nHow will you describe this man? <\/p>  <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n\r\n        <p> Someone rightly said, \"Forgiveness is the act of failing to revenge when the\r\nopportunity comes.\" It also means to overlook a wrong that has been done. Therefore,\r\nit can be likened to amnesty (official pardon) for someone who has done you wrong.\r\nThe summary of today\\'s lesson is that forgiveness is not just a one-way action from\r\nGod to a repentant sinner; it involves the whole community of God's people, their\r\nability to forgive one another, notwithstanding the number of times. It is also a\r\nreminder that forgiveness is vital in our relationships in spite of the number of times\r\nwe may have been hurt or ill-treated. Therefore, we are expected to forgive and not act\r\nlike the servant who received forgiveness, yet failed to forgive his offender. <\/p>  <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n\r\n        \r\n        <h4>THE LESSON EXPLAINED<\/h4>\r\n\r\n        <ol type=\"A\">\r\n\r\n        <li>\r\n        \r\n        <h5> A Servant Receives Forgiveness\r\nMatthew 18:21-27 <\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> Jesus had just addressed the issue of the greatest in the kingdom of heaven and\r\nreminded His disciples that entrance into the kingdom is granted to those who claim\r\nno rights before God but accept His gifts gladly like little children. From verse 21, He\r\ntold them a parable about the unforgiving servant in response to Peter's question on\r\nthe number of times forgiveness can be offered. Jesus answered, \"I tell you, not seven\r\ntimes, but seventy times seven .... (v. 22) To further explain the importance of\r\nforgiveness, Jesus likened the kingdom of heaven to a king who wanted to settle\r\naccounts with his servants when suddenly his debtor was brought before him. Perhaps\r\nas it was their custom then, the master ordered that he and his entire household be sold\r\nto settle the debt. However, the servant fell on his knees and passionately begged for\r\nmore time to settle his debt. Interestingly, the king had pity on him, cancelled the debt\r\nand set him free from the burden. Obviously, the king in the parable represents God\r\nwho always forgives our sins while the debt represents our sins. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> The issue of forgiveness is one of the hard teachings people find difficult to\r\npractice, even Christians. Some people who have been seriously hurt sometimes find\r\nit difficult to forgive. Instead, they prefer to revenge whenever they have the\r\nopportunity to do so and even wish their enemies dead. Peter knew the importance of\r\nforgiveness but possibly felt that there must be a limit, thus, he asked the number of\r\ntimes forgiveness could be granted. In fact, his suggestion of seven times is an\r\nindication that he is aware of the act of forgiving. However, he was stunned at Jesus'\r\nresponse of seventy times seven meaning that there is no limit to forgiveness. After all,\r\nGod forgives whenever we sin against Him. In the same vein, God expects Christians to forgive one another because they have also received forgiveness from Him. This\r\nwas Paul's understanding in his letter to the church in Colossae when he said, \"Bear\r\nwith each other and forgive whatever grievances you may have against one another.\r\nForgive as the Lord forgave you.\" (Colossians 3:13). <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> Why do some Christians pray for the death of their enemies as a way of revenge? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\r\n        <li> Jesus told Peter to forgive his offenders seventy times seven.

According to the passage, the servant was ungrateful and had forgotten he\r\nreceived forgiveness as a result of his inability to pay his debt. When he found his\r\nfellow servant who owed him a hundred denarii, he dragged him and asked for his\r\nmoney. Like he had done to the king and received pardon, the fellow servant fell to the\r\nground and begged him for more time to pay his debt but he refused the appeal. He had\r\nhim thrown into jail pending when he would be able to settle his debt. The man who\r\nhad been forgiven his huge debt could not forgive his debtor despite the plea. Afterall,\r\nthe amount owed him is insignificant compared to the one he owed his master for\r\nwhich he was forgiven. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> The parable of the wicked servant portrays the attitude of some Christians who do\r\nnot see the need to forgive their offenders even though they receive forgiveness from\r\nGod from time to time. The man failed to understand that the mercy he received from\r\nhis master put him under obligation to act with mercy to his fellow servant, no matter\r\nthe amount he owed him. Of course, his fellow servants were witnesses to his\r\nmeanness towards his debtor (v. 31). They were so grieved that they reported him to\r\ntheir master. Jesus knew that it was natural for humankind to retaliate every wrong\r\ndone to them; hence, He concluded His teaching with the emphasis to forgive people\r\ntheir sins so that we too will receive forgiveness. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> Why did the servant fail to forgive his debtor after he had been forgiven his debt? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\r\n        <li> Discuss some steps one can take to live amicably with someone who is\r\nunforgiving. <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\r\n       \r\n        <\/ol>\r\n\r\n        <\/li>\r\n\r\n <li>\r\n        \r\n        <h5> Consequences of Unforgiveness\r\nMatthew 18:32-35 <\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> The unforgiving servant did not know that every negative attitude or action naturally\r\nattracts consequences. He decided to throw his debtor into prison until he is able to\r\nsettle his debt. The wicked act was reported to the king who had earlier shown him\r\nmercy for his inability to pay his own debt. The master was furious about his action\r\nand said to him, \" Shouldn't you have had mercy on your fellow servant just as I had on\r\nyou?\" (v. 33) By implication, the king expected the servant to pardon his fellow\r\nservant by virtue of the fact that he had also been pardoned and his debt cancelled. In\r\nhis state of disappointment and anger, the master handed the servant to the jailer to be\r\ntortured until he is able to pay back everything he owed him. Jesus concluded the\r\nparable by saying, \"This is how my heavenly Father will treat each of you unless you\r\nforgive your brother from your heart.\" (v. 35). <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> The summary of the lesson is that God expects us to forgive one another, no\r\nmatter the magnitude of the offence or the number of times. In addition, when we\r\nforgive our offenders, we stand the chance of enjoying God's forgiveness. For\r\nexample, Jesus was emphatic about forgiveness when He taught His disciples the\r\nLord's Prayer. He said, \"For if you forgive men when they sin against you, your\r\nheavenly Father will also forgive you.\" (Matthew 6:14) But unfortunately, the\r\nservant, as described in the passage, lacked the understanding despite the fact that\r\nhe had enjoyed forgiveness from his master. He failed to understand that\r\nforgiveness is an expression of mercy. More so, the fact that he had received\r\nforgiveness from his master puts him under compulsion to forgive his fellow\r\nservant. It is, therefore, required of Christians to forgive one another and it must\r\nemanate from a sincere heart without any intention of vengeance whenever the\r\nopportunity arises. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> Based on today's lesson, is it necessary to be begged by our offenders before we\r\nforgive them or should we forgive whether or not we are begged? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\r\n        <li> It is not possible to forgive and forget.

Instead of providing the right\r\nleadership for God's people, they were only concerned with their outward\r\nappearances without living by what they taught according to the Law of Moses. They\r\ninsisted that people must observe certain rules and standards but they dismissed such\r\nrules whenever observance becomes personally inconvenient. As a result, Jesus\r\ngreatly criticised their activities but He, however, affirmed their teachings. <\/p>  <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n\r\n        \r\n        <h4>THE LESSON EXPLAINED<\/h4>\r\n\r\n        <ol type=\"A\">\r\n\r\n        <li>\r\n        \r\n        <h5> Necessary Warning against Imitation\r\nMatthew 23:1-4 <\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> The activities of the teachers of the law and the Pharisees were quite noticeable in the\r\ndays of Jesus. They were the authorised interpreters of the Law of Moses to the\r\npeople. They represent part of the Jewish leadership of Jesus' day and very often, they\r\ncriticised Him and some of His activities. As Jesus spoke to the people and His\r\ndisciples that gathered round Him, He warned them sternly against the activities of\r\nthese men because of their hypocritical lifestyle. The warning is found in verse 3\r\nwhere He said, \"So you must obey them and do everything they tell you. But do not do\r\nwhat they do, for they do not practice what they preach.\" The statement implies that\r\nJesus recognised the authenticity of the teachings of the Pharisees but condemned the\r\nimitation of their behaviour. Of course, the reason for the warning is clearly stated in\r\nverse 4: they put together grave demands and prohibitions that are heavy and difficult\r\nto adhere to, yet they were not willing to lift a finger to help the people follow these\r\nrules. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> Experience has shown that it is often easy for some leaders to make laws but\r\nthey find it difficult to keep such laws themselves. What is most important according\r\nto the passage is that such laws should be obeyed by all. Jesus' major concern about\r\nthe actions of the teachers of the law and the Pharisees was hypocrisy that\r\ncharacterised their lives. As those who assumed the place of Moses, they were\r\nexpected to explain the law and lead God's people by example instead of merely\r\ngiving commands. But rather, they placed so much emphasis on the rules and\r\nregulations that it became a burden to the people. So Jesus warned His disciples and\r\nother people who came to Him not to imitate the Pharisees who do not live by what they teach. This same warning is applicable to contemporary Christians to be ready to\r\nlive by example, in words and character. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> What are some negative qualities you think Christian leaders should rid\r\nthemselves of in order to avoid the type of condemnation of the Teachers of the\r\nLaw and Pharisees? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\r\n        <li> What ways can we show evidence of true and Christian leadership? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\r\n       \r\n        <\/ol>\r\n\r\n        <\/li>\r\n\r\n <li>\r\n        \r\n        <h5> The Sin of the Leaders Unveiled Matthew 23:5-8 <\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> Having warned His disciples and the other people that came to Him against imitating\r\nthe Pharisees and the teachers of the law, Jesus further unveiled their activities. In\r\nverses 5-8, He described their activities as mere pretentious show of their religion.\r\nAccording to Him, \"Everything they do is done for men to see ... because:\r\n        <\/p><ul>\r\n        <li> They make their phylacteries wide and the tassels on their garments long as a sign\r\nof dedication to God.

But Jesus warned that they (His disciples and other people who came\r\nto Him) should not assume that position or be called 'Teacher'. The reason is\r\nclearly stated: because they are all brothers and have just one Master (Jesus,\r\nHimself). <\/li>\r\n        <\/ul>\r\n  <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> The Pharisees and teachers of the law were condemned because they\r\nmisinterpreted the command of Moses about keeping the law. Instead of them, as\r\nleaders, to live by what they believed and taught, they wrongly applied it to the extent\r\nof reducing it to a mere outward ritual, thereby drawing attention to themselves.\r\nWithout doubt, the essence of the warning was to guard against seeking titles of\r\nhonour to foster pride as it was with these religious leaders. Little wonder Jesus told\r\nHis disciples not to be addressed as teachers because it does not attract any merit in\r\nthe presence of God. Only He (Christ) has the spiritual authority of Rabbi. Christians\r\nshould, therefore, note that in whatever position God has placed us, we are expected\r\nto demonstrate humility and live by example instead of using our office to oppress\r\npeople and mislead them. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> Discuss what it takes to live a Christian life without drawing attention to ourselves. <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\r\n        <li> What is the implication of Jesus' warning to believers in verse 8? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\r\n        <li> Which is more important, popularity or dignity? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 3-->\r\n        <\/ol>\r\n\r\n        <\/li>\r\n\r\n <li>\r\n        \r\n        <h5> Jesus Condemns the Leader's Hypocrisy\r\nMatthew 23:23-26 <\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> The passage contains seven woes as Jesus condemned the activities of religious\r\nleaders using different adjectives to qualify their ungodly behaviour (vv. 13-29).\r\nPrecisely in verse 23, Jesus denounced them because they only relied on strict\r\nobedience of rules about morality and ceremony. They were scrupulous in their\r\nconcern for tithe, even little garden herbs, while they ignored important matters of\r\nrighteousness, justice, mercy, and faith, which are God's requirement (Micah 6:8). For\r\nthat reason, Jesus described them as blind guides who strain out a gnat but swallow a\r\ncamel (v. 24). They carefully observed the unimportant ritual law and broke the\r\nimportant moral laws of justice. Jesus, therefore, commanded them to clean the inside\r\nas a result of which the outside will automatically be made clean. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> Particularly, it should be noted that Jesus did not blame them for their honesty in\r\ntithing but for their lack of a sense of spiritual value. In verses 25-26, Jesus denounced\r\nthem for paying more attention and ensuring that their cups and plates were\r\nceremonially clean, whereas they were full of greed. Christians should know that\r\nbeing religious is not enough. The Scripture says that our righteousness must exceed\r\nthat of the scribes and Pharisees. We must show that we understand God's demands as\r\nit pertains to justice, mercy and righteous living instead of living hypocritical lives.\r\nThe summary of the lesson is that we must be ready to confront hypocrisy among\r\nChristian leaders and officers who outwardly appear to be righteous in their religious\r\nperformance but are unrighteous in their personal lives. Jesus said that their interest in\r\nthe outside of the cup and plates is useless because all that is in these vessels have been\r\ncontaminated by the way they were acquired. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> In what ways can we deal with hypocrisy \u2013 finding faults in others and refusing to\r\nsee personal faults? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\r\n        <li> What are the things we consider more important in the Church that we need to pay\r\nattention to in our relationship with one another? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\r\n       \r\n        <\/ol>\r\n\r\n        <\/li>\r\n\r\n\r\n        <\/ol>\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h4> Prayer Points <\/h4>\r\n        <ul>\r\n        <li> Help me, O Lord, to be a good leader whose lifestyle is worthy of emulation. <\/li> <!-- Prayer Point 1-->\r\n        <li> O Lord, grant our leaders the grace to lead by example and in humility. <\/li> <!-- Prayer Point 2-->\r\n        <li> Lord Jesus, help us to understand that justice, mercy and faith are more important\r\nthan total compliance with ritual obligations. <\/li> <!-- Prayer Point 3-->\r\n        <\/ul>\r\n\r\n             <h4> Fellowship and Ministry Building Activities <\/h4>\r\n        <ul>\r\n        <li> Discuss what Jesus meant in verse 24 and possibly some lessons Christians\r\nshould learn from it. <\/li> <!-- Fellowship Activity 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <\/ul>\r\n\r\n           <h4> Take Home <\/h4>\r\n        \r\n        <ul>\r\n        \r\n        <li> Believers should model sincerity with integrity. <\/li> <!-- Take Home 1-->\r\n        <li> Christian leaders should be ready to lead by example. <\/li> <!-- Take Home 2-->\r\n        <li> Jesus is more interested in justice and mercy than compliance with ritual\r\nobligations. <\/li> <!-- Take Home 2-->\r\n        <li> It is sinful to know what is right and fail to do it or pretending as if it is\r\nunimportant. <\/li> <!-- Take Home 2-->\r\n        <\/ul><\/p>"},{"id":"28","title":"THE WIDOW AND THE UNJUST JUDGE","message":"<p><center>\r\n\r\n            <h4> July 15, 2018 <\/h4> <!--DATE-->\r\n            <h3> THE WIDOW AND THE UNJUST JUDGE <\/h3> <!--TOPIC-->\r\n\r\n        <p>\r\n        <p> Devotional Reading: Psalm 145:13b-20 <\/p> <!--Devotional Reading Passage-->\r\n        <p> Background Scripture \/ Lesson Scripture: Luke 18:1-8 <\/p> <!-- Background Scipture Passage-->\r\n       \r\n        <\/p>\r\n\r\n        <h4>Golden Text<\/h4>\r\n\r\n        <p> And will not God bring about justice for his chosen ones,\r\nwho cry out to him day and night?\r\n<b>Luke 18:7a<\/b> <\/p> <!-- Golden Text; Make Sure the scripture passage is made bold-->\r\n\r\n<\/center>\r\n\r\n        <h4>Objectives :<\/h4>\r\n        <p>By the end of the lesson, class members should be able to:<\/p>\r\n\r\n        <ul>\r\n        <li> State three reasons why it is\r\nimportant to persist in prayers. <\/li>   <!-- Objective 1-->\r\n        <li> Explain the difference between a call\r\nfor vengeance and justice in today's\r\ntext. <\/li>   <!-- Objective 2-->\r\n        <li> Express their resolution to be\r\npersistent in prayer like the widow in\r\ntoday's text <\/li>   <!-- Objective 3-->\r\n        <\/ul>\r\n\r\n        <h4>INTRODUCTION<\/h4>\r\n        <p> Mike Jnr is a 'miracle baby'. He\r\nwas born after his parents had\r\nwaited for a period of time. He\r\nis handsome and intelligent. He attends\r\none of the best schools in his community.\r\nEvery day, as his father takes him to\r\nschool, he points at a well-designed\r\nbicycle and asks his father to get one for\r\nhim. Every morning, he cries and points\r\nto the shop where the bicycle is being\r\nsold not minding every attempt of his father to make him realise his limited resources. Unfortunately, his father could not\r\nchange the route because that was the quickest route to his school. Mike Jnr never\r\nstopped crying, praying and asking God to bless him with the gift of a bicycle like the\r\none in the shop. One day, as he cried profusely, pointing and calling his father's\r\nattention to the direction of the shop, a passer-by stopped and made enquiry about\r\nMike's need. Surprisingly, the man walked into the shop and purchased the bicycle of\r\nhis choice for him. Out of excitement, his father said, \u201cYour persistence has worked\r\nfor you.\" <\/p>  <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n\r\n        <p> Persistence in prayer is one of the things Christians find difficult to do.\r\nGenerally, we believe that God should meet our needs instantly through some\r\nindividuals. We also forget that there are some people who are mean, they neither\r\nknow God nor pay attention to the needs of their fellow humankind. They find it\r\ndifficult to assist others except they are begged for what ordinarily should be handled\r\nas a responsibility and matter of importance. Such is the case of the judge in the\r\nparable in today's Bible passage. Although the judge proved to be indifferent to the\r\nwidow's plea for justice, he eventually succumbed to her desire because of her\r\npersistence. The focal point of today's lesson is the need for believers to be persistent\r\nin their faith and prayers even when it seems there is delayed justice. <\/p>  <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n\r\n        \r\n        <h4>THE LESSON EXPLAINED<\/h4>\r\n\r\n        <ol type=\"A\">\r\n\r\n        <li>\r\n        \r\n        <h5> The Persistent Plea of a Widow\r\nLuke 18:1-5 <\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> Jesus had just taught about the coming of the kingdom, which He said will become\r\nvisible to all humanity. Thereafter, He told them a parable of the widow and the unjust\r\njudge. The purpose of the parable was to encourage them to pray and never be\r\ndiscouraged. According to the parable, there was a judge in a certain town who was\r\nprobably appointed and paid by either Herod or the Romans to preside in their courts.\r\nAccording to verse 2, the judge was described as callous because he neither feared\r\nGod nor cared about his fellow humankind; perhaps one of those judges who are\r\nusually corrupt and known for demanding bribe from a claimant before justice can be\r\nserved. A woman in the city came to him every day with a plea to grant her justice\r\nagainst her enemy. Even though the judge initially refused to listen to the widow's\r\nplea because of his insensitivity and the fact that he did not care about her or anyone\r\nelse, he finally resolved to grant her request for two reasons: her persistence and\r\nprobably the fear of being worn out with her constant coming to him (v. 5). Although\r\nno one is sure what her issue was about, it is believed that the mention of a single\r\njudge probably means that the widow was seeking justice in a financial matter or she\r\nmay have been denied her inheritance. In other words, she simply demanded justice\r\nand not punishment for her enemies. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> There is no doubt that the widow's constant appeal to the unjust judge was\r\nalready a threat to his reputation in the community; hence, he changed his mind.\r\nNevertheless, Jesus told the parable to illustrate the fact that even when it seems God does not respond immediately to the prayers and requests of His people, He is not\r\nindifferent to their plight. This is encouragement for Christians not to give up\r\nwhenever it appears our prayers are not being attended to. Persistence in prayer is also\r\nrecommended by Paul in his letter to the church in Rome (Romans 12:12). When we\r\npersist in prayer and do not give up, our requests, if in accordance with the will of God,\r\nwould be granted. Persistence in prayer is a function of our faith in the all-powerful\r\nGod. Those who depend entirely on God will surely be vindicated and have their\r\nprayers answered. Whatever our desire may be, when we persist in prayer and\r\ncontinually seek the face of God, we will receive answers just like the widow in the\r\nparable and accomplish the will of God for our lives. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> Discuss other ways Christians can demand their rights e.g. position, money or\r\nlanded property other than going to court. <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\r\n        <li> Discuss this widow\\'s appeal whether it was a call for justice or vengeance. <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\r\n        <li> Where persistence in the demand for our right leads to misunderstanding, what\r\nshould we do and how else can we handle it? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 3-->\r\n        <\/ol>\r\n\r\n        <\/li>\r\n\r\n <li>\r\n        \r\n        <h5> God's Right Judgment\r\nLuke 18:6-8 <\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> As He continued with the parable, Jesus contrasted the attitude and response of the\r\nunjust judge with God's. He said, \"And will not God bring about justice for his chosen\r\nones, who cry out to him day and night? Will he keep putting them off?\" (v. 7) By\r\nimplication, Jesus meant that if an imperfect, wicked and unjust judge could respond\r\nto repeated requests of a helpless widow, how much more will the just God hastily\r\nbring justice to His own beloved people. Jesus' explanation also indicates that God\r\nhonours prayers offered consistently (day and night) and persistently. That is why He\r\nwould not keep putting off His chosen ones __ as the rhetorical question portrays: will\r\nHe keep putting them off? God is equally committed to ensuring that His chosen\r\npeople get justice quickly; that is, in good time (vv. 7a, 8a). Jesus concluded by asking\r\na cogent question: \"When the Son of Man comes, will He find faith on the earth?\" (v.\r\n8b) This suggests that some believers may compromise their faith perhaps due to\r\nunanswered prayers with regards to life's challenges or suffering caused by injustice. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> The implication of this passage is that if a corrupt and wicked judge finally did\r\nwhat was right (even though for ego or personal safety sake), will God in His mercy\r\nnot act swiftly on behalf of His oppressed people and give good gifts to those who ask\r\n(cf. Luke 11:9-13)? Consistency and persistence are the major keys believers should\r\nembrace and apply in order to secure answers to their requests, which they put before\r\nGod in prayers. However, the fact that God will act quickly to bring justice to His\r\npeople, as mentioned in this passage and the thought of Paul in Romans 16:20, does not negate the fact that God's people will endure some measure of injustice. Hence,\r\nChristians should not give-up their faith in times of temptation and tribulations\r\nbecause their prayers have not been answered. This is the essence of Jesus' call for\r\npersistence in prayer in verse 1 with the certainty that God will vindicate His people\r\nand answer their prayers, even more certainly than the unjust judge. As believers, we\r\nmust do everything possible to maintain our spiritual vibrancy in the face of God's\r\ndelay to respond to our prayers __ trusting that He will answer us in due course. More\r\nso, our timing or understanding of quickly is not the same as God's timing as He\r\nmakes everything beautiful in its time. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> Ask a class member to give a practical example of how he waited for an answer to\r\nhis prayer for a long time and what the experience has taught him. <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\r\n        <li> How can we help Christians who seem to be losing hope as a result of delayed\r\nanswers to their prayers? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\r\n        <li> <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 3-->\r\n        <\/ol>\r\n\r\n        <\/li>\r\n\r\n        <\/ol>\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h4> Prayer Points <\/h4>\r\n        <ul>\r\n        <li> Pray against all forms of injustice in our society, especially against widows who\r\nare helpless. <\/li> <!-- Prayer Point 1-->\r\n        <li> Pray that God will help our churches and individual Christians to pay\r\nattention to the needs of widows. <\/li> <!-- Prayer Point 2-->\r\n        <li> Pray that the Lord will help us not to lose faith as a result of seeming delay in\r\nanswer to our prayers. <\/li> <!-- Prayer Point 3-->\r\n        <\/ul>\r\n\r\n             <h4> Fellowship and Ministry Building Activities <\/h4>\r\n        <ul>\r\n        <li> Briefly role-play the parable of the widow and the unjust judge.

The summit was scheduled to\r\nstart by 6.30 a.m. with registration so, all\r\nthe invited guests were expected to arrive\r\nat the venue a day before, since the programme will commence at 8a.m. the next day. The day finally came and many people\r\nrushed to the venue to be registered early so that they could sit in front. The programme started at\r\nexactly 8a.m. and the door was closed to the amazement of those who were already seated.\r\nAbout an hour later, a few people came demanding to be allowed in since they came with their\r\ninvitation cards. They forgot that it was written on the invitation cards that late-comers will not\r\nbe allowed in. As a result, they lost the opportunity of being trained as business moguls. <\/p>  <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n\r\n        <p> Jesus likened entering into the kingdom of God as through a narrow door.\r\nThough the kingdom is open to everyone, it has a time limit by which every person is\r\nexpected to enter through faith in Jesus Christ. This is the summary of today's lesson. <\/p>  <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n\r\n        \r\n        <h4>THE LESSON EXPLAINED<\/h4>\r\n\r\n        <ol type=\"A\">\r\n\r\n        <li>\r\n        \r\n        <h5> God's Standard for Entering the Kingdom\r\nLuke 13:22-25 <\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> While Jesus was on His way to Jerusalem, He went through some towns and villages\r\nteaching the message of the kingdom. Probably having pondered on the subject of His\r\nteaching, someone asked Him a question saying, \"Lord, are only a few people going to\r\nbe saved?\" This question can also be traced back to Jesus' teaching about the\r\nnarrowness of the gate, which only a few can find (Matthew 7:14). According to verse\r\n24, it is observed that Jesus did not answer the question directly. Instead, He made\r\nthem know the standard of entering the kingdom. He said to them, \"Make every effort\r\nto enter through the narrow door, because many, I tell you, will try to enter and will not\r\nbe able to.\" The question may have emanated from the Jewish traditional belief about\r\ntheir position in Christ. Many of them believed that being a Jew automatically offered\r\nthem salvation and, therefore, they can enter the kingdom of God. Of course, this was\r\none of the reasons they always boasted that Abraham is their father (John 8:39). But\r\nJesus admonished them to personally strive to enter the kingdom through the narrow\r\ndoor (having faith in Jesus) before it will be too late (v. 25). However, we must\r\nunderstand that making effort as used in the passage, does not mean that we must do\r\nsome things to earn our salvation. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> Definitely, the narrow door represents faith in the Lord Jesus, His death and\r\nresurrection, which is the only way to eternal salvation (John 14:6). The most\r\nimportant thing is that every individual should strive to enter into the kingdom.\r\nThough we do not get saved by personal efforts (but by grace through faith -\r\nEphesians 2:8, 9); but after we have been saved, we must work out our salvation with\r\nfear and trembling. Those who are yet to be saved should know that the grace of\r\nsalvation will not be there forever. The reason for Jesus' warning is that once the owner\r\nof the house closes the door, the opportunity will be lost forever. Therefore, we must\r\nbe willing to pay the price and follow Jesus __ the only door to the kingdom so that we\r\nwill not be denied the opportunity of entering into God's kingdom. The decision for\r\neternal salvation (entering through the narrow door) or repentance from the path of\r\ndestruction\/backsliding should not be delayed so that it will not be too late. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> Discuss why it is important to be focused as we move on the narrow path to the\r\nkingdom. <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\r\n        <li> Discuss the areas of our lives that require serious amendments in order to enter the\r\nkingdom. <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\r\n        <li> What are some of the things that may likely hinder people from entering the\r\nkingdom? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 3-->\r\n        <\/ol>\r\n\r\n        <\/li>\r\n\r\n<li>\r\n        \r\n        <h5> A Banquet for All People\r\nLuke 13:26-30 <\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> The question someone asked Jesus about those who will be saved motivated Him to\r\nexplain the nature of the narrow door and the qualifications of those who will enter\r\nthrough it to the kingdom. In verse 26 Jesus said, when the door is finally closed, the\r\npeople who will come knocking and pleading to be allowed entry may be a reference\r\nto the Jews. The understanding is that they should be treated as members of the family\r\non the basis that they were familiar with Jesus __ they ate and drank with Him and He\r\ntaught in their streets. But the response will be \"I do not know you or where you come\r\nfrom. Away from me, all you evildoers! The response will definitely lead to weeping\r\nand gnashing of teeth by sinners, which symbolise mourning and torment. In fact, as it\r\nis described in the passage; the anguish will be severe, especially when they see the\r\n__\r\n__\r\npatriarchs Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and other prophets who were the recipients of\r\nGod's covenant enter the kingdom while they are shut out. People will come from all\r\nover the world, most likely believers, the saved, the elect and those who have been\r\n__\r\npreserved on the basis of their faith in Christ Jesus. These will include the Gentiles\r\npersons from every tribe and language and people and nations (Revelation 5:9; 7:9),\r\nand will take their places at the feast in the kingdom of God. The climax of the\r\nexperience is that those who are last will be first while the first will be last (v. 30). This\r\nmeans that the marginalised people in the society (the last) are also loved by God and\r\nmay be the first to be accepted into God's kingdom. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> The feast in this text may be the imagery of the messianic banquet, which shall be a\r\nreflection of the great joy that characterise God's kingdom. Therefore, missing this\r\ngreat joy will be enough reason to weep and gnash one\\'s teeth. Many Jews who had\r\ncounted on their privileged position as descendants of Abraham to gain entrance into\r\nGod's kingdom will find themselves shut outside when the kingdom comes. But the\r\nGentiles, whom the Jews believed would suffer eternal torment, and whom they felt\r\nwere unworthy of salvation are described by Jesus as sitting at the banquet table of the\r\nkingdom, along with the prophets and the patriarchs of Israel. This implies that there is\r\nopportunity for everyone, while the door remains open, to be serious with the message\r\nof salvation and respond to it accordingly before it is too late. Otherwise, they will be shut out of the kingdom of God. Similarly, those who have believed must hold on to\r\ntheir faith and maintain their spiritual stability so that they will not lose the joy of the\r\ngreat banquet in heaven. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> What is the place of today's lesson in evangelism? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\r\n        <li> Discuss the meaning and implications of verse 30 for believers. <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\r\n        \r\n        <\/ol>\r\n\r\n        <\/li>\r\n\r\n        <\/ol>\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h4> Prayer Points <\/h4>\r\n        <ul>\r\n        <li> Pray and ask God to help you to remain faithful so as to enter His kingdom. <\/li> <!-- Prayer Point 1-->\r\n        <li> Pray for God's help to make you qualify to partake of the heavenly banquet. <\/li> <!-- Prayer Point 2-->\r\n        <li> Ask God to help His church to be committed to evangelism, especially in this end-\r\ntime. <\/li> <!-- Prayer Point 3-->\r\n        <\/ul>\r\n\r\n             <h4> Fellowship and Ministry Building Activities <\/h4>\r\n        <ul>\r\n        <li> Ask class members to mention and discuss some possible steps Christians can take as\r\nthey make effort to enter the kingdom of God.

It is obvious that the normal\r\nhuman relationship that ought to exist\r\nbetween one person and another has\r\nparalised. We often see people who are\r\naffiliated either by language, gender, the\r\nlevel of education, profession and\r\nsometimes age group relate and do things\r\nin common. Sometimes, when there is an\r\noccasion that ought to be open for anyone\r\ninterested, it will be marked ''strictly by invitation' simply to put an impediment on the way of interested individuals. A couple\r\nnarrated their unpleasant experience when their distant relative gave out one of his\r\ndaughters in marriage. Apart from the fact that they were not specifically invited\r\nperhaps because of their low financial status, according to them, all the invited guests\r\nwere in different uniforms, beautifully dressed and seated together with enough food\r\nand drinks on their tables. Unfortunately, this couple, even though they are closely\r\nrelated to the father of the bride, were ignored because they did not belong to any\r\ngroup neither did they wear the same uniform (Aso-ebi) with the family members.\r\nThis kind of discrimination has continued for long, even among Christians. <\/p>  <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n\r\n        <p> Having reprimanded the people on the importance of humility and hospitality,\r\nJesus told the parable of the great feast simply to illustrate how people respond to the\r\ninvitation God gives through Jesus Christ. Of course, He knew that many people,\r\nespecially the religious leaders of His own nation would reject Him and His offer of\r\neternal redemption, giving the most trivial excuses. However, today's topic offers a\r\nstrong hope not only to the poor and those who have been despised, downtrodden,\r\ndehumanised and rejected by the society but also to others who will respond to God's\r\ngracious invitation of salvation along with its future blessing. This invitation will not\r\nbe restricted to a particular class of people but to all, irrespective of one's social status,\r\ntribe and language. <\/p>  <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n\r\n        \r\n        <h4>THE LESSON EXPLAINED<\/h4>\r\n\r\n        <ol type=\"A\">\r\n\r\n        <li>\r\n        \r\n        <h5> Invitation to the Great Banquet\r\nLuke 14:15-20 <\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> Jesus had just taught a lesson on humility and kindness having noticed how some of\r\nthe invited guests to a feast chose the best places for themselves. He concluded and\r\nadmonished the people on the importance of inviting those who are not able to return\r\ntheir kindness so as to receive God's blessing (vv. 1-14). The question asked in verse 2\r\nprompted Jesus to narrate the parable of the great banquet to illustrate the kind of\r\npeople who will enter God's kingdom. It was the parable of a certain man who\r\nprepared a banquet and invited many guests who were expected to indicate their\r\nwillingness to come so that food would be prepared accordingly. The reason is that it\r\nwas considered very irresponsible to attend a banquet if you were not invited.\r\nUnfortunately, they all gave different excuses on the day of the banquet. The fact that\r\nthey gave excuses for their failure to attend the banquet is an indication of four things:  \r\n        <\/p><ul>\r\n        <li> It can be considered a sign of irresponsibility to have accepted an invitation\r\nand fail to attend. <\/li>\r\n        <li> They had been invited before they began to make lame excuses. <\/li>\r\n        <li> They had other things to attend to, which were more important to them. <\/li>\r\n        <li> Their refusal to attend was a show of disrespect for the organiser of the\r\nbanquet. <\/li>\r\n        <\/ul>\r\n  <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> This passage paints a picture of God\\'s abundant provision and invitation of salvation,\r\nwhich was rejected by the Jews who did not accept the Messiah. The excuses they all\r\ngave are not genuine because no one would buy a field without first inspecting it, or\r\nbuy yoke of oxen without first trying them. More importantly, there is no reason why a\r\nnewly married man should not take his wife along to a banquet. Therefore, these\r\ninvited guests only showed their profound disrespect for their host despite the fact that\r\nthey had accepted the first invitation. Even today, many people give flimsy excuses\r\nfor not accepting God's offer of eternal life with the assumption that God will not be\r\nwicked enough to allow His children go to hell. Some even reject the offer with the\r\nexcuse that there is still time to do so. The heavenly banquet, which Christ has\r\nprepared for His bride (the church) is beautifully represented in this passage. The best\r\nway anyone can be prepared to enter the great banquet is to accept Jesus as Saviour\r\nand Lord thus becoming a Christian. We are also to work out our salvation with fear\r\nand trembling, walk in His ways and remain steadfast until the return of the Master. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> Why is it difficult for people to accept God's invitation of salvation? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\r\n        <li> Let class members discuss other worldly invitations that compete with God's. <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\r\n        \r\n        <\/ol>\r\n\r\n        <\/li>\r\n\r\n <li>\r\n        \r\n        <h5> Special Invitation to Special People\r\nLuke 14:21-24 <\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> It is natural for people to feel offended when their invitees disappoint them, especially\r\nwhen enough provision have been made for them. According to the passage, the\r\nreport of the servant about the refusal of the people to come did not go down well with\r\nthe master. He became furious because the meal would have been prepared according\r\nto the number of people who accepted the first invitation. For obvious reasons, the\r\nman ordered his servant to extend the invitation to the poor, crippled, blind and the\r\nlame who would not have ordinarily been allowed to attend the occasion so that his\r\nhouse would be full. The Pharisees had ignorantly placed many restrictions on who\r\nwould enter God's kingdom when actually God has extended His grace to everyone.\r\nInterestingly, these people represent the Jews who were despised and unable to\r\nobserve the traditional laws of ritual purity. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> The special invitation to the last set of people is significant because the\r\nPharisees had considered them to be unclean and, therefore, not fit to inherit the\r\nkingdom. Consequently, their invitation is a clear indication that the kingdom is open\r\nand available for everyone who accepts God's offer of salvation. God has graciously\r\n__\r\nextended this invitation of salvation to many to the Jews first and then to the\r\nGentiles. However, the rejection of Christ by the Jews finally opened the door of\r\nsalvation to the Gentiles. Those who failed to honour the invitation to the banquet obviously missed the joy of dining with the Master. Hence those who choose to reject\r\nChrist's offer of salvation will never taste the joy of salvation nor partake in the\r\nheavenly banquet. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> Discuss some common excuses people give for not accepting Jesus' offer of\r\nsalvation and how such people can be helped. <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\r\n        <li> What are the dangers of continually giving excuses concerning Christ's invitation? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\r\n        <li> What does the invitation to these classes of people in the society teach us about\r\nevangelism and salvation? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 3-->\r\n        <\/ol>\r\n\r\n        <\/li>\r\n\r\n\r\n        <\/ol>\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h4> Prayer Points <\/h4>\r\n        <ul>\r\n        <li> Appreciate God who has graciously extended the invitation of salvation to all. <\/li> <!-- Prayer Point 1-->\r\n        <li> Pray that God will help you to remain steadfast until His coming, in Jesus' Name. <\/li> <!-- Prayer Point 2-->\r\n        <li> Pray for those who have not known God in your family and community. <\/li> <!-- Prayer Point 3-->\r\n        <\/ul>\r\n\r\n             <h4> Fellowship and Ministry Building Activities <\/h4>\r\n        <ul>\r\n        <li> Let each class member write at least five common excuses people give for not\r\naccepting God's gift of salvation. <\/li> <!-- Fellowship Activity 1-->\r\n        <li> They are to pray for the unsaved in their families and communities for God to open\r\ntheir eyes that they may know Him and be saved. <\/li> <!-- Fellowship Activity 2-->\r\n        <\/ul>\r\n\r\n           <h4> Take Home <\/h4>\r\n        \r\n        <ul>\r\n        \r\n        <li> Believers should not discriminate concerning the kind of people with whom to\r\nfellowship. <\/li> <!-- Take Home 1-->\r\n        <li> Real generosity does not look for returns. <\/li> <!-- Take Home 2-->\r\n        <li> It is God's desire that all are saved. <\/li> <!-- Take Home 2-->\r\n        <li> Those who refuse God's gift of salvation will suffer the consequences. <\/li> <!-- Take Home 2-->\r\n        <\/ul><\/p>"},{"id":"31","title":"EQUITY FOR ALL","message":"<p><center>\r\n\r\n            <h4> August 5, 2018 <\/h4> <!--DATE-->\r\n            <h3> EQUITY FOR ALL <\/h3> <!--TOPIC-->\r\n\r\n        <p>\r\n        <p> Devotional Reading: Psalm 32 <\/p> <!--Devotional Reading Passage-->\r\n        <p> Background Scripture: Romans 2:1-16 <\/p> <!-- Background Scipture Passage-->\r\n        <p> Lesson Scripture: Romans 2:1-12 <\/p> <!-- Lesson Scipture Passage-->\r\n        <\/p>\r\n\r\n        <h4>Golden Text<\/h4>\r\n\r\n        <p> But glory, honour and peace for everyone who does\r\ngood: first for the Jew, then for the Gentile.

By virtue of\r\nhis new promotion, he was saddled with\r\nthe responsibility of supervising the\r\nactivities of the operation department in\r\nhis branch. As it was their tradition, every\r\nmorning, staff members would come\r\ntogether in their conference room to\r\nreceive instructions from their boss (Mr\r\nMike) before they begin the day's work.\r\nUnfortunately, Mr Mike was known to\r\ncome late to work and this usually delayed the commencement of operation for the day. Eventually when he comes, he\r\nwould yell at the staff members and accuse them of laziness, nonchalance and,\r\nsometimes, threaten to recommend them for dismissal. One day, a superior officer\r\nfrom the head office visited the branch and discovered that Mr Mike was yet to resume\r\nwork for the day. Upon investigation, he was reliably informed of Mr Mike's habitual\r\nlate coming to office yet, he would accuse other staff members of the same offence.\r\nThe Senior Officer who was furious at his arrogance and nonchalant attitude,\r\nhowever, accused him of being mean because he commits the same offence with\r\nothers yet, accuses and threatens them almost on daily basis. He declared that as much\r\nas possible, the bank will continue to maintain equal opportunity for all,\r\nnotwithstanding who is involved. <\/p>  <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n\r\n        <p> There were some Jews in the church in Rome who were proud because they\r\npossess and know God's law. As a result, they were quick to condemn the vices of the\r\npagan world whereas, they were as wicked as the pagans who do not know God and\r\nHis laws. In other words, they were not better than the pagans because they were\r\nguilty of the same offence of the unbelievers. Paul, therefore, reminded them that\r\nGod's judgment is with strict impartiality. He made them know that God will judge\r\neach individual according to his deeds. Therefore, those who reject the truth will\r\nreceive the wrath of God but those who continually do good will enjoy peace, glory\r\nand honour, whether Jew or Gentile (vv. 7-11). The focus of today's lesson is a\r\nreminder that God ahbors discrimination among His people. <\/p>  <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n\r\n        \r\n        <h4>THE LESSON EXPLAINED<\/h4>\r\n\r\n        <ol type=\"A\">\r\n\r\n        <li>\r\n        \r\n        <h5> God's Righteous Judgment Revealed\r\nRomans 2:1-5 <\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> One of the attributes of God is His impartiality in dealing with people. This was Paul's\r\nstrongest point when he confronted the Jewish readers about their shortcomings in\r\njudging others of the same offences they were guilty of. According to verse 2, he made\r\nit clear that the Jews have no moral justification to pass judgment on others because\r\nGod is always right when He judges. Moreover, he emphasised the fact that they will\r\nnot escape God's judgment, which is based on truth; otherwise, they will condemn\r\nthemselves because they do the same things. In verse 4, Paul asked an important\r\nquestion about their show of contempt for the riches of God's kindness, tolerance and\r\npatience without realising that His kindness can lead to repentance. Invariably, the\r\npurpose of God's kindness is to give opportunity to people to repent of their\r\nwickedness. Nevertheless, because of the stubbornness of people, their punishment\r\nwill be greater when God's anger and righteous judgment will be revealed (v. 5). <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> The actions of human beings are sometimes influenced by partiality,\r\nfavouritism and unfairness. The tone of Paul's letter has been described by some as a\r\nwarning than correction. However, he cautioned the attitude of the self-righteous\r\npeople who practise the sins common to humankind and yet they were quick to condemn others. This, of course, is an indication that the human judgment is always\r\nbiased. He compared their judgment with that of God who gives opportunity to sinners\r\nto change through His patience and kindness to all. He, however, made it clear that\r\nthey will not be able to escape the punishment of God at the end of age when God's\r\nfury will be revealed. The summary of the lesson is that Christians should be cautious\r\nof their conduct, especially in a society like ours that is characterised by wickedness\r\nand corruption. We should not be influenced or join the people of the world to do evil\r\nand thereafter criticise them. According to Paul, the punishment will be worse when\r\nGod shall come to judge His people. Even though it seems everyone has a high\r\ntendency to criticise others in words or thoughts like the Jews but the awareness that\r\nwe also stand to be condemned should make Christians refrain from criticising and\r\njudging others. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> Describe the different ways Christians discriminate among themselves today and\r\nhow this can be corrected. <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\r\n        <li> What are some excuses people give for judging others, even when they are guilty of\r\nthe same offence? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\r\n        <li> How can God's grace of equity be displayed to all when He forgives sins? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 3-->\r\n        <\/ol>\r\n\r\n        <\/li>\r\n\r\n <li>\r\n        \r\n        <h5> God's Impartial Judgment Revealed\r\nRomans 2:6-12 <\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> As Paul continued with God's righteous judgment, he became categorical in verse 6.\r\nHe said, \"God will give to each person according to what he has done.\" Thereafter, he\r\nmade a contrast between those who desire to do good and seek glory, honour and\r\nimmortality and those who reject the truth and continue in their evil ways. According\r\nto him, while the group that judges right is rewarded with glory, honour, peace and the\r\ngift of eternity, those who are self-seeking and reject the truth, thereby despising God's\r\npatience and kindness will be punished with God's wrath and anger (vv. 7-8). Both\r\ngroups shall be judged accordingly and the judgment will not be biased or hidden.\r\nConsequently, there will be great trouble and distress for the entire human race,\r\nparticularly the evildoers but glory, honour and peace will reign in the hearts of those\r\nwho do good, both the Jews and Gentiles. Of course, the reason is clearly stated in\r\nverse 11 that God does not show favouritism, no matter who is involved. However,\r\nPaul balanced his teaching with the conclusion that, \"All who sin apart from the law\r\nwill also perish apart from the law, and all who sin under the law will be judged by the\r\nlaw.\" (v. 12). <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> According to the passage, Paul made it clear that God is just in all His ways\r\nunlike humankind who sometimes show partiality in their judgment. More\r\nimportantly, God cannot be deceived to give reward in the place of punishment or\r\npunish those who should be rewarded as the wicked do. Little wonder the righteous got what they meted out (v. 9). Even though we live in a world where people show\r\npartiality without considering the consequence or the emotional trauma they put\r\npeople through, believers should refrain from the attitude of judging others. Instead,\r\nwe should be ready to correct our fellow brethren of their wrongdoing with love while\r\nwe watch ourselves so that we will not be tempted (Galatians 6:1). <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> Let at least two members briefly share how they felt recently when they were\r\npartially judged. <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\r\n        <li> What will be your suggestion for disciplinary action against an offending\r\ncongregant after today's study? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\r\n       \r\n        <\/ol>\r\n\r\n        <\/li>\r\n\r\n        <\/ol>\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h4> Prayer Points <\/h4>\r\n        <ul>\r\n        <li> Thank God for His righteous judgment. <\/li> <!-- Prayer Point 1-->\r\n        <li> Ask God to forgive you for previously judging others. <\/li> <!-- Prayer Point 2-->\r\n        <li> Ask the Lord to help you in carrying out any necessary disciplinary action to\r\noffenders with the aim of encouraging godly equity. <\/li> <!-- Prayer Point 3-->\r\n        <\/ul>\r\n\r\n             <h4> Fellowship and Ministry Building Activities <\/h4>\r\n        <ul>\r\n        <li> List the righteous judgments of God in the passage and discuss the possibility of\r\napplying them in our contemporary time. <\/li> <!-- Fellowship Activity 1-->\r\n        <li> Each member should make a commitment not to be a part of either tearing down\r\nthe Christian body through judgmental attitudes or giving up on salvation for the\r\nunbeliever through condemnation or criticism. <\/li> <!-- Fellowship Activity 2-->\r\n        <\/ul>\r\n\r\n           <h4> Take Home <\/h4>\r\n        \r\n        <ul>\r\n        \r\n        <li> God's judgment is always righteous, without partiality and of absolute equity. <\/li> <!-- Take Home 1-->\r\n        <li> Equity is a Christian virtue, which must be encouraged by all believers. <\/li> <!-- Take Home 2-->\r\n        <li> Disciplinary actions with godly equity will surely restore backsliding Christians\r\nrather than turn them to rebels. <\/li> <!-- Take Home 2-->\r\n        <li> Everyone will surely receive the righteous and unbiased judgment he deserves\r\nfrom God. <\/li> <!-- Take Home 2-->\r\n        \r\n        <\/ul><\/p>"},{"id":"32","title":"CHARITABLE EQUITY FOR ALL","message":"<p><center>\r\n\r\n            <h4> August 12, 2018 <\/h4> <!--DATE-->\r\n            <h3> CHARITABLE EQUITY FOR ALL <\/h3> <!--TOPIC-->\r\n\r\n        <p>\r\n        <p> Devotional Reading: Proverbs 3:9-10, 13-20, 27-28 <\/p> <!--Devotional Reading Passage-->\r\n        <p> Background Scripture: 2 Corinthians 8:9 <\/p> <!-- Background Scipture Passage-->\r\n        <p> Lesson Scripture: 2 Corinthians 8:7-15 <\/p> <!-- Lesson Scipture Passage-->\r\n        <\/p>\r\n\r\n        <h4>Golden Text<\/h4>\r\n\r\n        <p> For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ,\r\nthat though he was, yet or your sakes he became poor,\r\nso that you through his poverty might become rich.\r\n<b>2 Corinthians 8:9<\/b> <\/p> <!-- Golden Text; Make Sure the scripture passage is made bold-->\r\n\r\n<\/center>\r\n\r\n        <h4>Objectives :<\/h4>\r\n        <p>By the end of the lesson, class members should be able to:<\/p>\r\n\r\n        <ul>\r\n        <li> Identify the areas believers can\r\nemulate the attitude of the\r\nMacedonians who gave their best to\r\nsupport their brethren. <\/li>   <!-- Objective 1-->\r\n        <li> Discuss the benefits of giving and\r\nreceiving. <\/li>   <!-- Objective 2-->\r\n        <li> Make decisions as stewards to be\r\nequitable with their God-given\r\nresources. <\/li>   <!-- Objective 3-->\r\n        <\/ul>\r\n\r\n        <h4>INTRODUCTION<\/h4>\r\n        <p> Word Search 9 gave a beautiful\r\nillustration on charitable\r\ngiving and kindness. It used\r\nthe story of a woman who transferred\r\nkindness when she visited a coffee outlet\r\nsometime ago. Because of her unusual\r\ngiftedness in giving, this woman chose to\r\npay not only for her cup of coffee but also\r\nfor the person next to her on the queue.\r\nWhen the customer was told her cup of coffee had been paid for, she was pleased and decided to pay for the customer next to\r\nher. Interestingly, this pattern of charitable kindness was passed in relay form from\r\none customer to another through all the twenty seven customers who were on queue\r\nfor a cup of coffee. Chapters 8 and 9 of Paul's letter to the brethren in Corinth contain\r\nmostly instructions about the offering for the poor saints in Jerusalem who were\r\nsuffering from financial challenges. Titus had helped the Corinthians to make a good\r\nstart following Paul's instructions in his earlier letter to them (v. 6). To further\r\nencourage them to give, Paul wrote another letter to remind them of the need to\r\nsupport their Jewish fellow Christians and by so doing, they will learn the duty and\r\nblessing of systematic and generous giving. Today's lesson focuses on the need for\r\nbelievers to practise charitable equality for all, whenever the need arises. <\/p>  <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n        <h4>THE LESSON EXPLAINED<\/h4>\r\n\r\n        <ol type=\"A\">\r\n\r\n        <li>\r\n        \r\n        <h5> Encouragement to Give Generously\r\n2 Corinthians 8:7-12 <\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> Paul's major concern as he wrote this letter was how the Corinthians can give\r\ngenerously to support the saints in Jerusalem. In his attempt to encourage them, he\r\nrelated how the Macedonians had voluntarily and generously contributed to support\r\nthe brethren in Jerusalem out of their extreme poverty (vv. 1-2). He, therefore, used\r\nthem as an example to motivate the Corinthians to do likewise. Previously, Paul had\r\npraised and thanked God for the Corinthian church for the having spiritual gifts and\r\nfor eagerly waiting for the revelation of Jesus Christ (1Corinthians 1:4-8).\r\nConsequently, they were encouraged to also do well in the grace of charitable giving\r\nbesides their faith, speech, knowledge, complete earnestness and their love for them.\r\nPaul, however, affirmed that his instruction was not a command but a test to prove\r\ntheir love in enthusiastic giving. In verse 9, he made a reference to Jesus Christ who\r\nexemplified charitable giving that even though He was rich, He became poor so that\r\nthe poverty of humankind will be exchanged for His riches. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> It is commonly believed that humankind was born with the inclination to be\r\nselfish and, therefore, cannot easily part with their possession. However, the giving\r\nattitude of the Christians in Macedonian has proved this statement wrong.\r\nParticularly, Paul testified that they were under severe trial which resulted to a state of\r\npoverty (v. 3). Notwithstanding, they gave beyond their ability and so, they have\r\nbecome a reference for urging the Corinthian Christians to do likewise. By\r\nimplication, believers should emulate the Macedonians by meeting the needs of the\r\nneedy either in their family, church or our community so that there will be equality for\r\nall as it was the practice of the early church (Acts 4:32-35). For instance, churches and\r\nindividual families can choose to have food and clothes bank, bookstore (old and\r\nnew) and other resources purposely to help the poor. After all, the gift will be\r\nacceptable and become a blessing to the poor if the willingness is there (Mark 12:41-\r\n44). We should remember that we are stewards of God's resources in our possession; therefore, we are expected to be faithful and generously share our resources with\r\nothers as the need arises. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> Describe what our churches would look like when more churches exchange\r\ncharitable assistance <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\r\n        <li> Mention ministries and organisations you know that help people in need and take\r\nsome time to find their source of motivation. <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\r\n        <li> Discuss a discouraging experience you had recently in an attempt to share your\r\nresources with someone in need. <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 3-->\r\n        <\/ol>\r\n\r\n        <\/li>\r\n\r\n<li>\r\n        \r\n        <h5> Encouragement to Maintain Equity in Giving\r\nCorinthians 8:13-15 <\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> Apostle Paul was specific in his admonition to the Christians in Corinth regarding\r\ngenerous giving. He explained in these verses that the essence of being charitable is\r\nnot to cause inconveniences in the use of their resources even though it was meant for\r\nthe relief of their fellow brethren, thereby making them poor. Actually, his desire as he\r\npromoted equity among believers was to encourage the people to maintain God's\r\nstandard of fairness in their giving. The reason is that the surplus of some will be\r\nuseful for the deficiency of others and so they will complement one another. The idea\r\nis to practice the act of giving and receiving as it was in the tradition of the early\r\nchurch. By so doing, we will follow the example of Christ and ease the poverty and\r\noppression of the needy who live among us. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> The truth of this lesson is that every Christian does not have it all; therefore, we are\r\nbound to depend on one another for our needs to be met. When this is done, there will\r\nbe equity among God's people. More importantly, Christians should not only excel in\r\nfaith, speech, knowledge, earnestness and love, we must also understand and maintain\r\nthe practice of generous giving with the aim of bridging the gap between the rich and\r\npoor in our families, churches and communities (v. 7).

He was excited by his new faith and\r\nwas very much willing to learn and know\r\nmore about God. Soon, he got baptised\r\nand became a member of the choir in his\r\nchurch. Despite his busy schedule, he was committed to almost all the weekly programmes in the church, especially Bible\r\nstudy because of his desire to grow spiritually. One day, after the Bible study which\r\nwas focused on Romans chapter 12 with the topic \"Christian Conduct\", brother Musa\r\nbecame a little worried about the possibility of someone possessing all the qualities\r\nmentioned in the chapter. In fact, his major concern was the command not to revenge.\r\nIn his state of confusion, he walked up to the pastor and shared his worry.

Mainly, his concern in this chapter\r\nwas to encourage the brethren to live a transformed life as Christians. Beginning from\r\nverse 9, he systematically described some Christian qualities which the Roman\r\nChristians should display in their relationship with one another and in the community.\r\nThe encouragement expresses the need:\r\n        <\/p><ul>\r\n        <li> For Christian love: which must be sincere and complete. He means the type of\r\nlove that is not mere emotion but active and genuine. <\/li>\r\n        <li> To hate evil: They should abhor evil and love what is good and admirable. <\/li>\r\n        <li> For commitment to one another: He emphasised the importance of showing\r\nbrotherly love to one another. <\/li>\r\n        <li> To honour one another: they were expected to honour one another above\r\nthemselves and be zealous in their service to God. <\/li>\r\n        <li> To be joyful in hope, patient in suffering and faithful in prayer. <\/li>\r\n        <li> To give: They were to share their resources with the needy and so demonstrate\r\ntrue hospitality. In other words, the people were encouraged to open their homes\r\nto strangers.

Christian\r\nliving can be reflected in showing sincere love and just behaviour toward one another.\r\nIn doing this, we live as Christians, we will be able to influence others and live harmoniously. Unfortunately, it seems believers are not sensitive to the tricks of the\r\nDevil to cause hatred and disunity among God\\'s people to the extent that we are often\r\nprovoked to pay back with revenge.

While he encouraged the\r\nChristians to relate in love and practice true hospitality, he also envisaged the\r\npossibility of some people who will act in hatred and evil hence, he prescribed how\r\nChristians are to respond to such attitude. Beginning from verse 14, he advised that\r\nmaltreated believers should:\r\n        <\/p><ul>\r\n        <li> Ask God to bless (speak well of) those who persecute them and not curse. <\/li>\r\n        <li> Identify with those who rejoice and mourn with mourners. <\/li>\r\n        <li> Live in harmony with everyone. <\/li>\r\n        <li> Not be proud but be willing to associate with those of low status. <\/li>\r\n        <li> Not revenge but do what is right always. <\/li>\r\n        <li> Live in peace with one another. <\/li>\r\n        <\/ul>\r\n  <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> Unfortunately, as good as these instructions and commands are to believers, we\r\nlive in a world that is characterised by hatred, evil practices and the urge to revenge\r\nevery wrong done to us.

Although some people initially\r\ndoubted her conversion but she remained unswerving and focused in her faith and\r\nservices to God. She made it known to her friends that she has shifted from the old way of\r\nimmorality and disobedience to faith and obedience to God.

He distinguished between the old and new\r\nlifestyles and made them to understand that God abhors sin and will invariably make sure\r\nit is justly punished. Therefore, in order to avoid such punishment for sin, he instructed\r\nthe people to: put to death all evil desires like sexual immorality, impurity, lust, evil\r\ndesires and greed (v. 5). According to verses 7 and 8, he affirmed that even though they\r\nonce practiced these evil things, they must do away with them because they have taken\r\noff the old self and its practices. More so, they have put on the new life in Christ Jesus,\r\nwhich God is constantly renewing in His own image so that they can be brought into the\r\nfull knowledge of Himself. Consequently, there is no more division of any kind between\r\nGentiles and Greeks, circumcised and uncircumcised, barbarians and, Scythian\r\n(uncultured persons), slave or free. This declaration suggests that Jesus Christ transcends\r\nall barriers and so, He is the unifying factor of all races. Similarly, Paul reminded the\r\nGalatians that all have become one through Jesus Christ and are Abraham's seed and\r\nheirs according to the promise (Galatians 3:28). Without doubt, living a new life in Christ\r\nwill empower believers to seek justice both locally and globally. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> Paul was concerned about the spiritual growth of the brethren. His admonition\r\nwas primarily for them to forsake their evil ways of life and begin to live a new life in\r\nChrist, which is in accordance with the will of God for them. Immediately one confesses\r\nJesus Christ as Saviour and Lord, Jesus becomes our model in His love, relationship and\r\ncharacter; a lifestyle that is quite different from the old. He, therefore, appealed to them to\r\navoid evil habits like anger, passion and hateful feelings or lying which should only be\r\nseen with unbelievers. Paul also emphasised this when he talked about getting rid of lies, anger, harmful words, bitterness, insults and so on (Ephesians 4:25-32). The\r\nimplication, therefore, is that believers should depend on the Holy Spirit to help them\r\nexhibit godly character as we relate with other people, notwithstanding their religion,\r\nsex or race because Christ is all, and is in all (v. 11). When we begin to display godly\r\nattribute in our relationships, we will become models and light to other people. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> Why is it difficult for some people to exhibit godly character even after their\r\nconversion? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\r\n        <li> Discuss contemporary suggestions for Christian living in relation to the lesson. <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\r\n        <li> Discuss what Paul meant in verse 11 and how it relates with our relation to people\r\nfrom other religion. <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 3-->\r\n        <\/ol>\r\n\r\n        <\/li>\r\n\r\n<li>\r\n        \r\n        <h5> Admonition to Live as God's People\r\nColossians 3:12-14 <\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> Paul's appeal for the brethren in Colossae to begin to live a new life was necessitated\r\nby their new faith in Christ Jesus. Since they have become God's chosen people, they\r\nwere encouraged to practice justice and fairness toward one another as evidence of\r\ncompassion, kindness, humility, gentleness and patience. He added that tolerance and\r\nforgiveness should be their traits, especially whenever there is a misunderstanding\r\namong them. Paul also encouraged them to forgive. He said, \"Forgive as the Lord\r\nforgave you\" (v. 13b). They were to forgive as Christ forgave them showing the same\r\ndisposition and readiness to forgive an offender, as Christ has shown to them.\r\nBesides, they should love one another because love has the ability to bind together in\r\nperfect unity. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> The fact remains that every Christian has been chosen by God; therefore, we are\r\nexpected to live as people of God and exhibit godly qualities in our relationship with\r\nother believers. Paul's admonition is that we belong to one and the same God, redeemed\r\nby the same blood, and chosen by the same grace. This should lead Christians to\r\nmanifest a spirit of kindness, gentleness, and love towards one another. More\r\nimportantly, we must strive to live godly lives because of our election unto eternal\r\nsalvation as God's people. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> Should the offended wait to be begged before he or she forgives? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\r\n        <li> Can a person truly become perfect in character, especially in this evil society? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\r\n       \r\n        <\/ol>\r\n\r\n        <\/li>\r\n        \r\n        <li>\r\n        \r\n        <h5> Admonition to Embrace Peace\r\nColossians 3:15-17 <\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> Paul concludes his message, he became more resolute about his expectations from the\r\nbrethren in Colossae.

For instance, he wished that:\r\n        <\/p><ul>\r\n        <li> The peace that Christ gives of which they have been called will guide their daily\r\ndecisions and rule their hearts. Most especially that they are members of one\r\nbody and have been called to embrace peace; therefore, they should be thankful\r\n(v. 15).

When we know the importance of peace and pursue it, soon, it will spread like\r\nwhirlwind. Furthermore, the act of singing psalms, hymns and spiritual songs as\r\nrecorded by Paul can encourage believers to follow Christ's teachings and improve\r\nour worship attitude to God. Therefore, Christians should endeavour to develop the\r\nattitude of true worship through the singing of hymns and songs of praise to God for\r\nHis immeasurable blessings from time to time. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> Describe how the Word of God can dwell in us according to Paul's admonition in\r\nverse 16. <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\r\n        <li> Discuss the significance of singing hymns and Psalms in our worship services. <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\r\n        <li> Discuss the role of Christians in promoting peace in our troubled world. <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 3-->\r\n        <\/ol>\r\n\r\n        <\/li>\r\n\r\n        <\/ol>\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h4> Prayer Points <\/h4>\r\n        <ul>\r\n        <li> Pray that God will help you to promote fairness and justice to all people, in Jesus'\r\nName. <\/li> <!-- Prayer Point 1-->\r\n        <li> Help every Christian, O Lord, to live harmoniously with other people in this\r\nworld of hostility, in Jesus' Name. <\/li> <!-- Prayer Point 2-->\r\n        <li> I want to live in peace and be an agent of peace every day of my life. <\/li> <!-- Prayer Point 3-->\r\n        <\/ul>\r\n\r\n             <h4> Fellowship and Ministry Building Activities <\/h4>\r\n        <ul>\r\n        <li> How can we prove that all Christians are actually God's elect? <\/li> <!-- Fellowship Activity 1-->\r\n        <li> Ask the class members to carefully examine the virtues in the passage and\r\nunderline the one they not have and pray for the grace of God to continue to help\r\nthem. <\/li> <!-- Fellowship Activity 2-->\r\n        <\/ul>\r\n\r\n           <h4> Take Home <\/h4>\r\n        \r\n        <ul>\r\n        \r\n        <li> We are called to show love to others as God's chosen people. <\/li> <!-- Take Home 1-->\r\n        <li> Christians are to get rid of any ungodly attitude because of the new life we now\r\nlive in Christ. <\/li> <!-- Take Home 2-->\r\n        <li> There is no distinction in the body of Christ. <\/li> <!-- Take Home 2-->\r\n        <li> We have been called to forgive our offenders just as God has forgiven us our\r\ntrespasses. <\/li> <!-- Take Home 2-->\r\n        <\/ul><\/p>"},{"id":"36","title":"GOD CREATED THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH","message":"<p><\/p><center>\r\n\r\n            <h4> September 2, 2018 <\/h4> <!--DATE-->\r\n            <h3> GOD CREATED THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH <\/h3> <!--TOPIC-->\r\n\r\n        <p>\r\n        <\/p><p> Devotional Reading: Psalm 33:1-9 <\/p> <!--Devotional Reading Passage-->\r\n        <p> Background Scripture \/ Lesson Scripture: Genesis 1:1-13 <\/p> <!-- Background Scipture Passage-->\r\n       \r\n        <p><\/p>\r\n\r\n        <h4>Golden Text<\/h4>\r\n\r\n        <p> In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.

The teacher taught explicitly the\r\nstory of creation with relevant Bible\r\npassages. She composed and led the\r\nchildren to sing a song that further\r\nconfirmed that God is the Creator of the\r\nheavens and the earth. Suddenly, the\r\nteacher noticed that one of the children did\r\nnot sing or respond in any way. The child\r\nlooked confused and probably needed\r\nmore clarification. When she asked the child why he looked confused, he demanded to know the possibility of one single\r\nperson to have created the heavens and the earth and everything in it. <\/p>  <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n\r\n        <p> Sometime ago, some men made attempt to discredit God and His power to create.\r\nThey decided to propound a theory that the earth came into existence as a result of\r\nevolution. According to the story, after several failed attempts, these men finally\r\nconcluded that truly God is the Creator of the heavens and the earth. Their conclusion,\r\nof course, is in consonance with the Scriptures that God was at the beginning when\r\nnothing else was. Therefore, He is the Originator, Creator and Sustainer of the\r\nuniverse. Today's lesson focuses on the account of creation in Genesis chapter 1 when\r\nnothing existed, but God alone. Consequently, the passage teaches us three basic\r\ntruths about God: He is eternal, creative, and distinct from His creation because He\r\nwas not created. <\/p>  <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n\r\n        \r\n        <h4>THE LESSON EXPLAINED<\/h4>\r\n\r\n        <ol type=\"A\">\r\n\r\n        <li>\r\n        \r\n        <h5> God's Good Beginning\r\nGenesis 1:1-5 <\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> The story of the creation has always been an interesting topic for discussion. It reveals\r\nand confirms the creative power of God with which He created the heavens and the\r\nearth in the beginning. According to verse 2, three things are revealed about the earth:\r\nit was without shape, covered with darkness and the Spirit of God was hovering over\r\nthe waters. God started His work of creation when He commanded light to appear and\r\nbecause He saw that it was good, He separated it from darkness and called it day, while He\r\ncalled darkness night. God's attestation that the creation was good testifies to the fact that there\r\nwas no disorder or imperfection in what He had done. It could also mean the excellent state of\r\nGod\\'s creation. There was evening and morning of the first day He began the work of creation\r\n(v. 5). In the Old Testament, light was symbolic of life and blessings (2 Samuel 22:29; Job 3:20) but\r\nPaul used the word \u201cLight\u201d to illustrate God's re-creating work in sin-darkened hearts (2\r\nCorinthians 4:6). God called the light day, and darkness He called night. The purpose of the\r\naccount, therefore, was to demonstrate the power of the spoken word in confirming the fact that\r\neverything God created was good (v. 9). <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> We can see from the passage that all things started with God. The author of the book of\r\nEcclesiastes also testified to the fact that God created everything in heaven and the earth\r\n(Ecclesiastes 1:5). The passage, therefore, is a reminder of the pre-existence of God who\r\ncreated the heavens and the earth. Secondly, it counteracts the concept confronting the modern\r\nman, especially the scientists who have tried to fashion out their own creation story. The\r\n__\r\nScripture declares that in the beginning, \u201cGod created the heavens and the earth\u201d the origin of\r\nevery creature. From a formless and chaotic world, He formed everything into an orderly\r\nuniverse to be inhabited by all living creatures. He would bring into being (Isaiah 45:18).\r\nThus, \u201cthe Spirit of God was moving over the face of the waters,\u201d watching over the\r\nworld that was being created. This connotes that more things were being anticipated\r\nto take place. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> What does darkness in the passage signify? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\r\n        <li> Why did God choose to create light above other things? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\r\n        <li> Discuss the importance of evaluation as seen in verse 4. <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 3-->\r\n        <\/ol>\r\n\r\n        <\/li>\r\n\r\n <li>\r\n        \r\n        <h5> God's Creative Words\r\nGenesis 1:6-10 <\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> God's work of creation was in sequence.

The description of the activities in the\r\npassage comprises the formation of the land mass and the gathering of surface waters\r\ninto oceans and seas. The matters were separated from the land to constitute the earth\r\nand to form the seas, probably to make possible luxuriant plants and trees to grow and\r\nbring forth fruits and food for humankind. God called the expanse \"sky\" and there was\r\nevening and morning of the second day. In verse 9, God also commanded the coming\r\ntogether of the water in the sky in one place so that the land will appear and it was so.\r\nConsequently, the land was named \"earth\" and the water that had come together was\r\ncalled \"sea\".

Therefore, He is the foundation of all creation having been in\r\nexistence before the beginning of His creative act. <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\r\n        <li> Why was God's creation in sequence and what lessons can we learn from it? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\r\n      \r\n        <\/ol>\r\n\r\n        <\/li>\r\n\r\n <li>\r\n        \r\n        <h5> God's Distinctive Power in Creation\r\nGenesis 1:11-13 <\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> The fact has been established that the world and everything in it were created through\r\nGod's creative power, which continued in this passage. First was the \u201clight\u201d (v. 3), and\r\nthe waters below the expanse and waters above the expanse (v. 7). The dry land and the vegetation, yet none of the creatures was like Him (God). In verse 11, God\r\ncommanded the land to produce vegetation, seed-bearing plants and trees on the land\r\nthat bear fruit with seeds in it according to their kinds and it was done according to His\r\nwords (v. 13). Consequently, God was pleased with everything He had created. On the\r\nthird day, there was evening and there was morning (v. 13). <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> The attributes of God revealed in this lesson indicate God's distinctiveness from\r\neverything He created, so, He is Eternal.

Notable in the passage\r\nis that after the creative activities of the first three days, God observed that everything\r\nwas good. This statement stresses the excellence of God, which is repeated\r\nthroughout the story of creation. The work of creation was done in sequence and in an\r\norderly manner.

He is known in the\r\nchurch and community to be\r\nresponsible and hard working. Sometime\r\nago, he was given a contract by the\r\nFederal Government to construct some\r\noffice furniture. Because he did not want\r\nto bring disrepute to his name, he decided\r\nto engage the services of some of his\r\ncolleagues. The work began in earnest\r\nand the logs were cut into various shapes\r\nand sizes for easy assembling. Tools like nails of various sizes, hammer, leather and other materials were ready for use. After\r\nsome days, when the pieces of wood and the other equipment had been put together,\r\nthey became beautiful office furniture to behold. <\/p>  <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n\r\n        <p> As God's creative work progressed, His word became the tool by which all\r\nheavenly bodies, plants and animals were created. This is indicative of the fact that the\r\ncreation and development of the universe were the will of God. He chose to create the\r\nworld and His word was the medium by which His desire was accomplished; hence,\r\nthe constant expression: \u201cAnd God said ....\u201d Through those inspired words, the\r\ncreative power by which God brought order out of the formlessness and emptiness of\r\nthe world flowed out. This whole process of creation reveals His power in creation.\r\nFrom this point, the wonders in God\\'s word became more potent as the heavenly\r\nbodies began to appear. This is the focal point of today's lesson. <\/p>  <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n\r\n        \r\n        <h4>THE LESSON EXPLAINED<\/h4>\r\n\r\n        <ol type=\"A\">\r\n\r\n        <li>\r\n        \r\n        <h5> The Creation of Lights\r\nGenesis 1:14-19 <\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> The story of creation was in stages and each stage was characterised by different\r\nactions. According to verses 14 and 15, God commanded light to appear in the expanse\r\nof the sky for three reasons:\r\n        <\/p><ul>\r\n        <li> To separate the day from the night. <\/li>\r\n        <li> To mark the times of days, years and seasons. These events were solely\r\ndetermined by the phase of the moon. <\/li>\r\n        <li> To shine in the sky to illuminate the earth. <\/li>\r\n        <\/ul>\r\n The Scripture says that it was done according to the creative words of God. Of\r\ncourse, it can be seen as a further development of what God started to do on the first\r\nday, when He said, 'Let there be light, and there was light' (v. 3). In verse 16, God also\r\ncreated two great lights. According to the New International Version Commentary, the\r\ngreater light was to govern the day and the lesser was to govern the night including the\r\nstars. Some Bible commentators support the fact that the writer deliberately avoided\r\nthe words \u201csun\" and \u201cmoon\u201d since both were used as names for the pagan gods\r\nassociated with those heavenly bodies. They are light-givers to be appreciated, but not\r\npowers to be feared or worshipped (Isaiah 40:26). Notable also in the passage is that\r\nthe lights are carefully positioned in the sky so that they can illuminate the earth, to\r\nrule over the day and night and to separate darkness from light (v. 17). Again, God was\r\npleased with what He had done.  <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> The importance of light to humankind and animals cannot be overemphasised.\r\nHaving created both the great and lesser lights, God gave different functions to them.\r\nWhile the sun was to govern the day, the moon was made to govern the night and the\r\nstars help the moon to rule the night (Psalm 136:9). Furthermore, these lights were\r\ncreated for signs of the change of weather, so that the farmer may order his affairs with\r\ndiscretion\/wisdom. They also give light upon the earth, so that we too may walk (John11:9) and work (John 9:4) as the duty of everyday requires. However, as important as\r\nthese lights are, God did not make them to be worshipped. It is folly to making them\r\ndeities (objects of worship) and give them divine honour, when God has given us\r\ndominion over all He has created including the sun, moon and stars. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> Discuss why some people worship created things instead of the Creator? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\r\n        <li> How should Christians respond to God's creation? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\r\n       \r\n        <\/ol>\r\n\r\n        <\/li>\r\n\r\n <li>\r\n        \r\n        <h5> The Creation of Animals\r\nGenesis 1:20-23 <\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> As God continued in the creation exercise, He saw the need to also create animals that\r\nlive both in the water and air. He said, \u201cLet the water teem with living creatures, and\r\nlet birds fly above the earth across the expanse of the sky\u201d (v. 20). He also created the\r\ngreat sea monsters (probably dreaded marine monsters, which were regarded as God's\r\nenemies in the ancient world, Psalm 104:26). After creation, the fish were conditioned\r\nto live in water while the birds flew in the air. These of course were the products of the\r\nfifth day's creative activity of God. He also commanded the creatures that live in\r\nwater to reproduce their kind and to populate the sea; the birds were expected to also\r\nincrease in number. However, it does appear that God moved from the \u201csmall\u201d to the\r\n\u201cgreat\u201d; nonetheless, all were important. All these happened on the fifth day of\r\ncreation. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> Ultimately, the progression of the story of creation is worthy of note; on the\r\nfirst and second days, God created inanimate things while on the third day; He created\r\nthe vegetation, which shall bear fruits according to their kinds. On the fourth day, the\r\ngreat lights appeared to illuminate the world and become the light of life. On the fifth\r\nday, He created animal life and commanded them saying, \u201cBe fruitful and multiply\u201d,\r\nthe same command He gave to humankind after creation (v. 28). By this divine\r\nblessing, animals are expected to multiply both in the sea and in the air. In fact, we can\r\nsee that God's blessings upon these animals brought multiplication and fruitfulness;\r\nhence, the fish of the sea and the birds have remained innumerable because of their\r\nability to reproduce. By God's standard, everything He had created was good (v. 21).\r\nWith the appearance of both the animals of the sea and air, creation proceeded\r\nprogressively to prepare for God's highest earthly creature, humankind. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> Ask members to discuss their understanding of God, especially in relation to the\r\ncreation <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\r\n        <li> Let class members mention an animal, whether in the sea or air, and discuss its\r\nimportance to humankind <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\r\n       \r\n        <\/ol>\r\n\r\n        <\/li>\r\n\r\n <li>\r\n        \r\n        <h5> The Creation of Land Animals\r\nGenesis 1:24-25 <\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> God's creation story progressed without hindrance. The sixth day was the final stage\r\nof creation, in which God brought the world into its perfect form. He commanded the\r\nland to produce living creatures according to their kinds, which can be classified into\r\ndomestic, wild and small (literally, creatures that crawl on the ground). These\r\nanimals may include reptiles (creeping things), insects, mice etc. Consequently, God\r\nmade them all and He affirmed that what He had made was good. Of course, this was\r\nwith a sense of satisfaction as He had originally intended. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> Again, it should be noted that these created animals, both small and big, were\r\nendowed with the ability to reproduce, thereby participating in procreation according\r\nto God's command. However, God did not conclude His process of creation with\r\nthese animals. The climax was His plan to make a creature in His image and likeness\r\nwho will be endowed with authority to rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the\r\nair and over every living creature that moves on the ground (v. 28).

They all\r\nbelieve different versions of the\r\nstory of creation. The atheist believes\r\nthat man evolved progressively from an\r\nanimal called ape. The traditional\r\nworshipper said his forefather told him\r\nthat man came into existence through a\r\nmysterious and uncontrollable wind\r\nmany years ago. The Christian simply\r\nmade reference to the biblical account of\r\nGod's creation, which includes humankind. Because of the differences in claims, the atheist and traditional\r\nworshipper both agreed to go home and pray for more insight and converge again the\r\nnext day. Interestingly, they came back with the testimony of God's revelation that He\r\nis the Creator and Sustainer of the universe. <\/p>  <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n\r\n        <p> Today's lesson focuses on the Creator, God. In fact, the highest point of all His\r\ncreative acts was the making of humankind, distinguished from all other creatures\r\nbecause of God's Spirit in them that makes them bear His image. It was entirely a new\r\ndimension of creation that concluded the creative activities of the sixth day.\r\nHumankind was created in collaboration with the Trinity. God said, \u201cLet us make man\r\nin our image.\u201d (v. 26) In other words, God the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit were\r\ninvolved in the creation of humankind and this was the crown of all creation. God's\r\npurpose was to create humankind in His likeness and give them authority and control\r\nover all other creatures that He had made. Consequently, humans became superior to\r\nany of the other animals. Humankind is a distinct, unique and special creation by God.\r\nWe were created to have pre-eminent position as the crown of all creation and given\r\nthe privilege to participate in procreation according to God's plan. <\/p>  <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n\r\n        \r\n        <h4>THE LESSON EXPLAINED<\/h4>\r\n\r\n        <ol type=\"A\">\r\n\r\n        <li>\r\n        \r\n        <h5> God Made Man in His Image\r\nGenesis 1:26-28 <\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> As observed in verse 1, everything God created was called into existence according to\r\nHis word. The climax of His creative activities on the sixth day was the creation of\r\nhumankind. He said in verse 26, \u201cLet us make man in our image, in our likeness, and\r\nlet them rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air, ...\u201d So God created\r\nhumankind, male and female, in His own image. He then blessed them saying:\r\n        <\/p><ul>\r\n        <li> Be fruitful and increase in number: This is a command to reproduce offspring\r\naccording to their resemblance. <\/li>\r\n        <li> Fill the earth and subdue it.

Other Scriptures confirm that God's Spirit took part in the creation (Job 33:4;\r\nPsalm 104:30). In like manner, Paul tells us that God\\'s Son, Jesus Christ, was at work in\r\nthe creation of humankind (Colossians 1:16). In addition, the phrase \u201cin our image or\r\nlikeness\u201d is more about having God's essential nature rather than His physical likeness.\r\nNotably, of all creation, only humankind is described as being made in the likeness of\r\nGod. It is something that distinguishes humans from other animals that were created on\r\nthe sixth day. Although God had given other higher animals the ability to reproduce, this\r\nis the first and only time \u201cmale and female\u201d were distinctly mentioned. It establishes the\r\nfact that there is a special relationship between humankind and God. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li discuss=\"\" the=\"\" value=\"\" of=\"\" human=\"\" beings=\"\" on=\"\" account=\"\" god\\'s=\"\" creation=\"\" according=\"\" to=\"\" passage.=\"\" <=\"\" li=\"\"> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\r\n        <\/li><li> Discuss the differences between humankind and the other animals and the\r\nimplication for all humankind. <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\r\n        <li> How should humankind respond to God who has created them specially? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 3-->\r\n        \r\n        <\/ol>\r\n\r\n        <\/li>\r\n\r\n <li>\r\n        \r\n        <h5> Created to Rule and Have Control\r\nGenesis 1:29-31 <\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> The climax of God's creative activity was the making of humankind and some other\r\nanimals on the sixth day.

They will be yours for food.\u201d Of\r\ncourse, the command to exercise authority over His creature includes all the beasts of\r\nthe earth and all the birds of the air and every creature that moves on the ground.\r\nPrincipally, every green plant was also given to humankind to serve as food (v. 30).\r\nInterestingly, God saw that what He had made was very good.

God ultimately rules over the earth, but He has relinquished part of His\r\nauthority to humankind as it can be seen in the passage. By this directive given to\r\nhumankind, God has granted us some measure of dominion apparently to participate\r\nin recreation, and to take responsibility for the environment and other animals.\r\nTherefore, humankind should appreciate God's goodness and not be wasteful or\r\ncareless as we carry out this noble assignment. God was careful when He created this\r\nworld; we too, must be careful with the way we care for the world He has entrusted to\r\nus to have dominion over, rule and control. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> Is it true that human activities have harmed the natural world more than it has\r\nhelped it? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\r\n        <li> Identify some ways humankind have misused God\\'s creation and how to correct\r\nit. <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\r\n        \r\n        <\/ol>\r\n\r\n        <\/li>\r\n\r\n <li>\r\n        \r\n        <h5> The Creation of Humankind\r\nGenesis 2:4-7 <\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> God completed His work of creation on the sixth day. On the seventh day, He stopped\r\nworking. He rested, blessed the day and dedicated it exclusively for the service and worship of Him, our Creator (Genesis 2:1-3). Initially, when God created the world,\r\nthere were no plants and no seeds germinated because there was no rain to water the\r\nsoil and no one to cultivate it. This of course was as a result of the fact that humankind\r\nhad not been created. However, there was water from beneath the surface of the earth\r\nto water the ground. Consequently, He took some soil from the ground and formed\r\nhumans out of it. Humankind became a living being having received the breath of God\r\nthrough His nostrils. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> There are two exceptional facts in the creation of humankind. We were not created\r\nsimply by God's command like every other creature. Rather, it involved an action in\r\nwhich God took some soil from the ground and breathed the breath of life into it and\r\nhumankind became a living soul. This account further confirms the fact that God is the\r\nCreator of humankind. He created humans and gave us authority to rule and have\r\ndominion over all other animals. Humankind has also been made the crown of all\r\ncreations and God's representative on earth. We should, therefore, respond to God\r\nthrough sincere worship and exhibit a high sense of wisdom to control other creatures. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> When God created humankind, He provided enough food for their sustenance.\r\nWhat does this portray about God as far as provision is concerned? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\r\n        <li> Why was humankind created differently from other animals? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\r\n        <li> Discuss the value of humans as part of God's creation. <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 3-->\r\n        <\/ol>\r\n\r\n        <\/li>\r\n\r\n        <\/ol>\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h4> Prayer Points <\/h4>\r\n        <ul>\r\n        <li> Appreciate God for creating you in His image and likeness. <\/li> <!-- Prayer Point 1-->\r\n        <li> Pray that God will grant you the grace to respond to Him always as a steward. <\/li> <!-- Prayer Point 2-->\r\n        <li> Help me, Lord, to be able to witness to unbelievers about Your power to create. <\/li> <!-- Prayer Point 3-->\r\n        <\/ul>\r\n\r\n             <h4> Fellowship and Ministry Building Activities <\/h4>\r\n        <ul>\r\n        <li> Make a list of some of the attributes humankind share with God. <\/li> <!-- Fellowship Activity 1-->\r\n        <li> Lead class members to pray for the grace of God to be responsible stewards. <\/li> <!-- Fellowship Activity 2-->\r\n        <\/ul>\r\n\r\n           <h4> Take Home <\/h4>\r\n        \r\n        <ul>\r\n        \r\n        <li> We are created in the divine image of God. <\/li> <!-- Take Home 1-->\r\n        <li> Every human being has value as part of God's creation. <\/li> <!-- Take Home 2-->\r\n        <li> We should worship God with gratitude for the privilege of being blessed by Him. <\/li> <!-- Take Home 2-->\r\n        <li> God is still in the process of creation. <\/li> <!-- Take Home 2-->\r\n        <li> Everything in the world was made by God, humankind inclusive. <\/li> <!-- Take Home 2-->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <\/ul><\/p>"},{"id":"39","title":"GOD CREATED THE FAMILY","message":"<p><center>\r\n\r\n            <h4> September 23, 2018 <\/h4> <!--DATE-->\r\n            <h3> GOD CREATED THE FAMILY <\/h3> <!--TOPIC-->\r\n\r\n        <p>\r\n        <p> Devotional Reading: Leviticus 19:11-18 <\/p> <!--Devotional Reading Passage-->\r\n        <p> Background Scripture: Genesis 2:18-24; 4:1-2 <\/p> <!-- Background Scipture Passage-->\r\n        \r\n        <\/p>\r\n\r\n        <h4>Golden Text<\/h4>\r\n\r\n        <p> For this reason a man will leave his father and\r\nmother and be united to his wife, and they will become one flesh.\r\n<b>Genesis 2:24<\/b> <\/p> <!-- Golden Text; Make Sure the scripture passage is made bold-->\r\n\r\n<\/center>\r\n\r\n        <h4>Objectives :<\/h4>\r\n        <p>By the end of the lesson, class members should be able to:<\/p>\r\n\r\n        <ul>\r\n        <li> Define marriage and God's intention\r\nfor creating the woman. <\/li>   <!-- Objective 1-->\r\n        <li> Discuss the implication of creating\r\nthe woman with the rib from the side\r\nof the man and not from his head. <\/li>   <!-- Objective 2-->\r\n        <li> Demonstrate the willingness to\r\npromote love, peace and harmony in\r\ntheir families. <\/li>   <!-- Objective 3-->\r\n        <\/ul>\r\n\r\n        <h4>INTRODUCTION<\/h4>\r\n        <p> One Sunday, a Sunday School\r\nteacher walked into the class and\r\nasked the class members to\r\nmention at least ten things God created.\r\nSurprisingly, none of them remembered\r\nmarriage. It is possible they did not know\r\nthat marriage was one of the things God\r\ncreated as we shall study today. In the\r\nprevious lessons, we learnt that God\r\ncreated all living and non-living things\r\nincluding humankind, whom He created\r\non the sixth day. In chapter 1 verse 27, God created both male and female, but there was no detailed account as to how the\r\nfemale was created until chapter 2. After God had created different kinds of animals,\r\nthe Scripture tells us that there was no resemblance of Adam even though God had\r\ngiven him the opportunity to name all the animals. Invariably, God knew that having a\r\nsingle sex would not be good enough, especially as regards fulfilling the mandate to\r\nbe fruitful and increase in number (Genesis 1:28). Then, He decided to create the\r\nwoman as \u201ca suitable help meet for Adam; particularly as the animals were not\r\nsuitable companions for him. Consequently, the focus of today's lesson is how God\r\ncreated the first family through whom humankind came into existence. <\/p>  <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n\r\n        \r\n        <h4>THE LESSON EXPLAINED<\/h4>\r\n\r\n        <ol type=\"A\">\r\n\r\n        <li>\r\n        \r\n        <h5> A Companion Made for Adam\r\nGenesis 2:18-24 <\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> After the creation of man, God put him in the Garden of Eden to work and care for it.\r\nHe also gave him freedom to eat from any tree in the garden except the tree of the\r\nknowledge of good and evil (vv. 15-16). Having formed the trees, the beast of the field\r\nand the birds of the air from the ground, He brought them to Adam to name them,\r\nthereby showing the dominion earlier given to him (Genesis 1:26). For Adam, there\r\nwas no suitable companion, thus, God created the woman from his ribs and presented\r\nher to Adam. Neither the birds nor animals could provide the needed companionship\r\nfor Him. Therefore, He said, \u201cI will make a helper suitable for him.\u201d This literally\r\nmeans a partner who would complement and make Adam complete. When Adam saw\r\nthe woman, he expressed satisfaction and immediately composed a lyric poetry\r\nsaying:\r\n\"This is now bone of my bones\r\nand flesh of my very flesh;\r\nshe shall be called 'Woman,'\r\nfor she was taken out of man.\" <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> It is apparent from the passage that the creative activity of God was not complete\r\nuntil the woman was created. He caused Adam to fall into a deep sleep, and took a rib\r\nfrom his side with which He made the woman and brought her to him. In fact, this is an\r\nindication that in marriage, which is the coming together of a man and a woman under\r\nGod's command, the couple symbolically become one flesh and no sex is superior to\r\nthe other. According to verse 14, God has established the institution of marriage as\r\nhaving priority over the parent\/child relationship since the man is expected to leave\r\nhis parents and be united to his wife in one flesh. By implication, the two of them shall\r\nbe one flesh and considered as one body, having no separate or independent rights,\r\nprivileges, cares and concerns. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> Discuss the significance of taking one of the ribs of the man to create the woman\r\nand not any other part of the body. <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\r\n        <li> Explain the meaning of the phrase \u201ca helper suitable for him\u201d and its implication\r\nfor marriage. v. 18b. <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\r\n        <li> What are the implications of a man leaving his parents only to cleave to his wife? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 3-->\r\n        <\/ol>\r\n\r\n        <\/li>\r\n\r\n  <li>\r\n        \r\n        <h5> The Significance of the Creation of Woman\r\nGenesis 4:1-2 <\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> One of the things that distinguish God from humankind is that He is faithful to His\r\npromises unlike humans who sometimes demonstrate slackness. After the creation of\r\nthe man and woman, God blessed them and said, \u201cBe fruitful and increase in number\r\nand fill the water in the seas, and let the birds increase on the earth\u201d (Genesis 1:28).\r\nInvariably, He commanded humankind to procreate and fill the earth. Nevertheless,\r\nthis promise came to pass after the fall of humankind. Verses 1 and 2 of chapter 4\r\ndescribe the fulfilment of God's initial plan of multiplication for humankind. The\r\nScripture says that Adam had sexual relationship with his wife, Eve, and she became\r\npregnant. Eventually, she bore her first born son and gave him the name Cain, which\r\nin Hebrew language means \u201cacquired\u201d and the second, Abel, meaning \u201ca breath\u201d. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> God is the Originator of marriage. From the passage, one can see the\r\nsignificance of marriage and family as ordained by God. Cain and Abel, and their\r\nparents were together as a family having been brought to life by their parents.\r\nTherefore, the creation of the woman was an indication that:\r\n        <\/p><ul>\r\n        <li> The man needed a companion because humans are social beings and cannot afford\r\nto be alone for life, except in times of solitude. <\/li>\r\n        <li> The capacity to procreate and populate the earth became complete. In fact, the\r\nuniqueness of marriage is revealed in this passage because it provides the\r\nintimate relationship in which human companionship reaches its peak. <\/li>\r\n        <\/ul>\r\n  <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> If it is the will of God that couples should be co-equals in marriage and not a\r\nmaster-servant relationship why then do some men treat their wives as not\r\nimportant in decision-making in the home? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\r\n        <li> Why do some people refuse to get married having known that God is the\r\nOriginator of marriage? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\r\n        <li> Discuss some lessons in today's passage that can help Christian couples to\r\nstrengthen their relationships. <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 3-->\r\n        <\/ol>\r\n\r\n        <\/li>\r\n\r\n        <\/ol>\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h4> Prayer Points <\/h4>\r\n        <ul>\r\n        <li> Help me, O God, to understand the value of marriage according to Your standard. <\/li> <!-- Prayer Point 1-->\r\n        <li> Help every married couple to see their partners as their companion and not\r\nslaves\/servants. <\/li> <!-- Prayer Point 2-->\r\n        <li> Pray that God will intervene in every home that is at the verge of collapse. <\/li> <!-- Prayer Point 3-->\r\n        <\/ul>\r\n\r\n             <h4> Fellowship and Ministry Building Activities <\/h4>\r\n        <ul>\r\n        <li> Two class members, preferably a male and a female, should dramatise the action of\r\nAdam when he saw Eve. <\/li> <!-- Fellowship Activity 1-->\r\n        <li> Let each member of the class get a partner and pray for both the singles and married\r\nfor God's will to be done in their lives. <\/li> <!-- Fellowship Activity 2-->\r\n        <\/ul>\r\n\r\n           <h4> Take Home <\/h4>\r\n        \r\n        <ul>\r\n        \r\n        <li> God is the Originator of marriage. <\/li> <!-- Take Home 1-->\r\n        <li> God is interested in who and how we marry, as Christians. <\/li> <!-- Take Home 2-->\r\n        <li> Procreation is part of God's reason for creating the woman. <\/li> <!-- Take Home 2-->\r\n        <li> Believers should endeavour to extend the love of God through our families in the\r\nway they care for one another. <\/li> <!-- Take Home 2-->\r\n        <li> Christian couples should complement each other. <\/li> <!-- Take Home 2-->\r\n        \r\n        <\/ul><\/p>"},{"id":"40","title":"GOD CREATES, HUMANS SIN","message":"<p><center>\r\n\r\n            <h4> September 30, 2018 <\/h4> <!--DATE-->\r\n            <h3> GOD CREATES, HUMANS SIN <\/h3> <!--TOPIC-->\r\n\r\n        <p>\r\n        <p> Devotional Reading: Psalm 51:1-12 <\/p> <!--Devotional Reading Passage-->\r\n        <p> Background Scripture: Genesis 3 <\/p> <!-- Background Scipture Passage-->\r\n        <p> Lesson Scripture: Genesis 3:8-17, 20-24 <\/p> <!-- Lesson Scipture Passage-->\r\n        <\/p>\r\n\r\n        <h4>Golden Text<\/h4>\r\n\r\n        <p> So, the LORD God banished him from the\r\nGarden of Eden to work the ground from which he had been taken.\r\n<b>Genesis 3:23<\/b> <\/p> <!-- Golden Text; Make Sure the scripture passage is made bold-->\r\n\r\n<\/center>\r\n\r\n        <h4>Objectives :<\/h4>\r\n        <p>By the end of the lesson, class members should be able to:<\/p>\r\n\r\n        <ul>\r\n        <li> Discuss the consequences of sin in the\r\nlife of humans. <\/li>   <!-- Objective 1-->\r\n        <li> Identify the effects of the sin of Adam\r\non humanity. <\/li>   <!-- Objective 2-->\r\n        <li> \u00b7\r\nIdentify the effects of the sin of Adam\r\non humanity. <\/li>   <!-- Objective 3-->\r\n        <\/ul>\r\n\r\n        <h4>INTRODUCTION<\/h4>\r\n        <p> His father left the home with a\r\nstern warning that he should\r\nneither go out nor bring his\r\nfriends into the compound to play.\r\nHowever, not long after his father left,\r\nPaul invited his friends and they began to\r\nplay football in the compound against his\r\nfather's instruction. In the process, the\r\nwindscreen of one of the cars broke. In\r\nfear and anticipation of the punishment\r\nthat awaits him, Paul broke down in tears\r\nand hid when he heard the sound of his\r\nfather's car later in the day. His father was\r\nsurprised that Paul refused to open the\r\ngate as it was his usual practice.\r\nImmediately, he suspected something unusual had happened. Paul was duly punishment by his father for disobeying his\r\norder. <\/p>  <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n\r\n        <p> Genesis chapter 3 is the beginning of a new scene after the creation of\r\neverything. God brought Adam and Eve into the Garden of Eden. They both lived a\r\nmutual and fulfilled life, being in fellowship with God and in companionship with\r\neach other. After all, the environment in the garden provided a beautiful surrounding\r\nand their needs were always met until things suddenly changed. The serpent subtly\r\ndeceived the woman to eat from the forbidden fruit and so distorted God's plan for\r\nthem. Because they were convinced by the serpent that they would be better off as\r\nautonomous individuals than living in subordinate obedience to God, God's original\r\nplan for them was altered. Today's lesson focuses on the origin of sin (the fall of\r\nhumankind) and the consequences that followed. <\/p>  <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n\r\n        \r\n        <h4>THE LESSON EXPLAINED<\/h4>\r\n\r\n        <ol type=\"A\">\r\n\r\n        <li>\r\n        \r\n        <h5> Man's Alienation from God\r\nGenesis 3:8-10 <\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> The account of how sin came into the world emphasises the fact that human beings\r\nare answerable for their actions and must suffer the consequences of their sins\r\n(Galatians 6:7-9). When God instituted the first family, Adam and Eve, He made\r\neverything available that would make life comfortable for them in the garden.\r\nUnfortunately, they forfeited the privilege when they ate the forbidden fruit. Of\r\ncourse, the aftermath of their disobedience was alienation from God. They hid among\r\nthe trees of the garden when they heard the sound of the Lord as He was walking in the\r\ncool of the day. But because God is omnipresent, He was aware of their sin thus He\r\ncalled to the man saying, \u201cWhere are you?\u201d (v. 9) According to verse 10, the man's\r\nresponse was not a direct answer to God's question of where are you. He simply said,\r\n\u201cI heard you in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked; so I hid.\" <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> It is obvious that until the appearance of the serpent, there was no sin or evil in the\r\nworld because everything God created was good. Although the serpent had promised\r\nthem that they would become like God, knowing good and evil when they eat the fruit\r\nbut it did not come true as expected. However, God's probing question: \u201cWhere are\r\nyou?\u201d stirred up a sense of guilt, nakedness, fear and shame in Adam and Eve.\r\nConsequently, their constant and sweet relationship with God was marred and finally\r\nthey were alienated from Him, which means spiritual death. In other words, they\r\ncould no longer have fellowship with God (v. 8). Apparently, separation, isolation,\r\nfear and sense of guilt are some of the consequences of sin in the life of humankind.\r\nThe only antidote is confession and genuine repentance. Even today, many people no\r\nlonger enjoy sweet fellowship with God because of their sinful nature but when we\r\nconfess and ask for forgiveness, He will hear and restore us to Himself. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> Discuss the implication of God's question \u201cWhere are you\u201d? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\r\n        <li> What would have been the couple's best reply to God? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\r\n        <li> Identify some ways Christians behave like Adam and Eve, who hid when they\r\nheard the sound of God. <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 3-->\r\n        <\/ol>\r\n\r\n        <\/li>\r\n\r\n<li>\r\n        \r\n        <h5> Declaration of Punishment\r\nGenesis 3:11-17 <\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> This passage starts with a question to Adam and his wife, Eve. After their response to\r\nGod's question of \u201cWhere are you\u201d God asked two important questions. He said,\r\n\u201cWho told you that you are naked? Have you eaten from the tree that I commanded\r\nyou not to eat from?\u201d Again, instead of taking responsibility for their actions, they\r\n(Adam and Eve) resorted to shifting blames; accusations and counter accusations.\r\nAdam blamed Eve for giving him the fruit while Eve blamed the serpent for tempting\r\nher. This is a true reflection of the attitude of some believers who often shift blames to\r\nothers after they have sinned instead of asking for forgiveness. Invariably, both of\r\nthem failed to accept responsibility for their disobedience to God's command. God,\r\ntherefore, pronounced curses and punishment on them. Thus:\r\n       <\/p><ul> \r\n       <li> The serpent was cursed above all livestock and wild animals. <\/li>\r\n       <li> It will begin to crawl on its belly and feed on dust. <\/li>\r\n       <li> Enmity was put between the serpent and the woman, even their offspring. It\r\nwas fulfilled in Christ\\'s victory over Satan (Romans 16:20).\r\nTo the woman: <\/li>\r\n       <li> Her pain during childbirth will be greatly increased. <\/li>\r\n       <li> Her desire will be for her husband. <\/li>\r\n       <li> Her husband will rule over her. <\/li>\r\n       <\/ul>\r\n  <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> To the man: The ground was cursed and through painful labour, he will produce\r\nwhat he would eat throughout his lifetime. Unfortunately, these pronouncements\r\nhave greatly affected humankind. There is always hostility between man and snakes\r\nand there is no childbirth without pain. In addition, women are perpetually under the\r\ncontrol of their husbands who struggle to live by the fruit of their labour. It is not\r\nuncommon that some people continuously live in sin without the consciousness of the\r\npunishment from God. Apostle Paul said, \u201cFor the wages of sin is death, but the gift of\r\nGod is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.\u201d (Romans 6:23). Therefore, believers\r\nshould endeavour to live holy lives so that we will escape the punishment that awaits\r\nsinners. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> Apart from the serpent, the architect of the sin, did Adam and Eve deserve the\r\npunishment they received? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\r\n        <li> What was the mistake of Adam in verse 12 and what are some ways Christians\r\nbehave like him today? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\r\n        <li> Discuss the various ways Satan deceives people today. <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 3-->\r\n        <\/ol>\r\n\r\n        <\/li>\r\n        \r\n        <li>\r\n        \r\n        <h5> God's Plan of Redemption and Restoration\r\nGenesis 3:20-24 <\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> One of the attributes of God is compassion. Immediately He pronounced judgment\r\non Adam and Eve, God also made adequate plans for their redemption and\r\nrestoration. He made garments of animal skins to clothe them since they were naked.\r\nHe concluded that since humankind have possessed the knowledge of what is good\r\nand bad, they must not be allowed to take from the fruit that gives life (v. 22).\r\nSubsequently, they were sent out of the Garden of Eden so that the man would begin\r\nto cultivate the soil from which he has been formed according to God's\r\npronouncement. Furthermore, God made adequate provision to secure the garden.\r\nSo, living creatures and flaming sword, which rotates in all directions, were put at the\r\neast side of the garden.

Therefore, she grew to\r\nbe responsible, dutiful and committed to\r\nher studies throughout her days in the\r\nuniversity. She never attended parties or\r\nstayed away from classes even though\r\nthat was the practice of almost everyone\r\nin her hostel. Despite the effort of the school management to curb the girls and make them know the consequences of their\r\nactions, they remained defiant. However, because of Sister Grace's disciplined\r\nlifestyle; she was always attentive in class. Regardless of being ridiculed by friends,\r\nshe was focused and refused to compromise her faith. She eventually emerged the\r\nbest graduating student, which qualified her for a scholarship to study in any\r\nuniversity of her choice outside the country while others were disqualified. <\/p>  <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n\r\n        <p> The story of Noah and the ark is quite familiar and the lessons are true and ever\r\nrelevant. His days were characterised by so much wickedness that God was grieved\r\nthat He ever made humankind. God, therefore, swore to wipe off humanity but He was\r\npleased with Noah because he was upright in his relationship with God. Despite the\r\nevil in his days, He was described as holy and blameless. Consequently, God\r\ncommanded Noah to construct an ark for himself and his family and Noah obeyed and\r\ndid everything according to the command of God. This is the focus of today's lesson. <\/p>  <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n\r\n        \r\n        <h4>THE LESSON EXPLAINED<\/h4>\r\n\r\n        <ol type=\"A\">\r\n\r\n        <li>\r\n        \r\n        <h5> Noah: A Just Man\r\nGenesis 6:9-13 <\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> The first few verses of the chapter describe the wicked activities of humankind on the\r\nsurface of the earth as they began to increase (v. 1). The earth was corrupt and full of\r\nviolence. A similar phenomenon is prevalent in Nigeria today like: kidnapping, ritual\r\nkilling, sexual immorality, stealing, etc. Because of God\\'s nature of holiness, He was\r\ngrieved that He ever created humankind. Therefore, He resolved to wipe off\r\nhumankind and animals that move on the ground and the birds of the air (vv. 1-8, 13).\r\nHowever, God found a man (Noah) to be righteous and blameless despite the corrupt\r\npractices of his days. Apostle Peter called him a preacher of righteousness (2 Peter\r\n2:5). He also walked with God. In other words, his lifestyle was in contrast to the\r\npeople of his days. Even though he may not be completely free from sin, he lived\r\nrighteously (Psalm 15:2-5). His consistent faith in God made him just and blameless. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> The dictionary defines righteousness as \u201cbehaviour that is morally justifiable\r\nor right.\u201d Such a behaviour is characterised by accepted standards of morality, justice,\r\nvirtue, or uprightness. Apart from Noah, the Bible has a record of people who were\r\ndescribed as righteous and blameless in the sight of God because of their genuine faith\r\nand obedient lifestyle. For example, Zechariah and Elizabeth, his wife (Luke 1:6);\r\nAbel (Hebrews 11:4); Daniel and Job (Ezekiel 14:14). These men did not compromise\r\ntheir faith because the people of their days were corrupt and violent (v. 11). This\r\nfurther emphasises the fact that the way of life of people in the society is not an excuse\r\nfor anyone to engage in sin. Unfortunately today, some people, including Christians\r\nsay, \u201cIf you cannot beat them, you join them\u201d simply to justify their wicked practices.\r\nIn fact, the lesson is a reminder that God expects His people to live holy lives without\r\nregardless of the prevailing circumstances. This can be done when we give our lives to\r\nGod and allow the Holy Spirit to direct our affairs daily. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> Can we still find people like Noah in this generation? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\r\n        <li> Discuss how Noah was able to abstain from the corruption of his days. <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\r\n        <li> How can one live blamelessly in this perverse world? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 3-->\r\n        <\/ol>\r\n\r\n        <\/li>\r\n\r\n<li>\r\n        \r\n        <h5> The Command to Make an Ark\r\nGenesis 6:14-18 <\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> The fact has been established that because of humankind\\'s violent and corrupt deeds,\r\nGod resolved to put an end to the existence of all people on earth, except Noah whom\r\nHe found to be righteous and blameless (v. 13). In verse 14, God commanded Noah to\r\nconstruct an ark for himself with detailed specifications before He would carry out\r\nthe planned destruction. The ark was to be built with cypress wood; possibly the type\r\nthat will not be affected by water or termite. The shape of the ark would be box-like\r\nand from the specifications it will be 450 feet long, 75 feet wide and 45 feet high\r\n(approximately 11\u20442 standard football field length). Furthermore, Noah was\r\ncommanded to make a roof on the ark of 18 inches to the top, a door on the side with\r\nlower, middle and upper decks (vv. 14-16), probably for ventilation. At least for the\r\nfirst time, God stated clearly how he intends to destroy the earth. He said, \u201cI am going\r\nto bring floodwaters on the earth to destroy all life under the heavens, every creature\r\nthat has the breath of life in it ....\u201d In fact, it is emphatically stated that everything on\r\nearth will perish (v. 17). But God promised to establish a covenant relationship with\r\nNoah, which suggests that he and his family will not be destroyed by the flood. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> The story of Noah, the ark and the flood is one of the well-known Bible stories\r\nof all times. God decided to put an end to the evil on earth through flood (v. 13). The\r\nphrase, \u201call people of the earth\u201d indicates that the effect of the flood was going to be\r\nuniversal. After all, the universal corruption of the world also demands that the\r\npunishment must be universal. Therefore, it will affect all creatures; they will be\r\nwiped off (Genesis 6:7). But God will preserve Noah\\'s life and that of every member\r\nof his family. Note that when sin (corruption, killing, wickedness, etc.) become the\r\nnorms in a nation like the days of Noah, such a nation is destined for ruin. However,\r\nGod will always care and protect the righteous that have not compromised their faith.\r\nPeter description of Noah's experience (1 Peter 3:20; 2 Peter 2:5), suggested that the\r\naccount should be seen more as God's saving humanity from sinful self-destruction\r\nthan merely as punishment for sin. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> Apart from total destruction, are there other means God would have used to end\r\nthe existence of all wicked people on earth?

Thereafter, God began to unfold His plans.\r\nAccording to verses 19 and 20, Noah was given two specific instructions: To bring\r\n__\r\ninto the ark two of all living creatures male and female, which will be kept with him\r\nalive in the ark. He was also to take along every kind of food for him and his family\r\nmembers for the period the flood will last. Obviously, to an ordinary man, these\r\ninstructions about the construction of the ark would have seemed cumbersome and so\r\nkeeping to the details would be difficult. But the Scripture says that Noah did everything\r\njust as God commanded him (v. 22), which stresses his complete obedience to God. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> One of the greatest lessons in today's passage is that God decided to extend His\r\nloving concern not only to Noah but to his whole family as they were saved from the\r\ndisaster. It is also noteworthy that Noah demonstrated total and not partial obedience\r\nto God in all the instructions he was given. He, therefore, displayed one of the virtues\r\nof a righteous and blameless man. This made God protect him, his sons, wife and sons'\r\nwives from the effect of the great flood. Ultimately, Noah became one of the biblical\r\nheroes whose obedience and uprightness have remained a model to all believers. By\r\nthis, all Christians should know that God's commandments and instructions must be\r\nstrictly followed, no matter how burdensome we think they are. This is important\r\nbecause God delights in complete obedience to Him and obedience is better than\r\nsacrifice. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> How easy is it to follow God's instructions, especially when they seem not to make\r\nsense to us? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\r\n        <li> According to the passage, God's saving grace was extended to Noah's family as\r\nthey were saved from destruction.

The issue of\r\ngenealogy is a serious one in that many\r\npeople have ignorantly been trapped in\r\nrelationships because they knew little or\r\nnothing about their lineage. A story was\r\ntold about Sister Faith and Brother Simon\r\nwho grew up in the same community in the early 80\u2019s. Accidentally, they attended the same primary and secondary school.\r\nDuring their university days, they belonged to the same fellowship and had their\r\nNational Youth Service in the same state. They were known to be close friends even by\r\ntheir parents. Immediately after their Youth Service Corp, Brother Simon who said he\r\nhad prayed and had the conviction to marry sister Faith made his intention known to\r\nher. In fact, sister Faith wasted no time in giving her consent. Out of excitement, they\r\ndecided to inform their parents and probably pick a date for family introduction. <\/p>  <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n\r\n        <p> Unfortunately, when the two families met on the day of introduction, it was\r\ndiscovered that Brother Simon and Sister Faith are from the same lineage and so they\r\ncannot get married. As they both realised that it was not proper for them to get married,\r\nthey blamed their parents for failing to make them know their lineage early enough.\r\nToday's lesson places emphasis on the importance of knowing our genealogy.\r\nGenealogy is indispensable as it lays the foundation for all that follows. God can be\r\nseen working through genealogies. <\/p>  <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n\r\n        \r\n        <h4>THE LESSON EXPLAINED<\/h4>\r\n\r\n        <ol type=\"A\">\r\n\r\n        <li>\r\n        \r\n        <h5> Noah's Son's Descendants\r\nGenesis 10:2; 11:10, 27 <\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> The passage has a comprehensive account of Noah and his descendants. The sons of\r\nNoah who came out of the ark after the flood disaster were Shem, Ham (the father of\r\nCanaan) and Jepheth (v. 2). Therefore, the three sons of Noah are the ancestors of all\r\nthe people of the earth (Genesis 9:18). Just as it is natural for different families on\r\nearth to reproduce so it was with Noah and his three children. Noah's three sons had\r\ntheir own descendants after them. First, according to verse 2, Gomer, Magog, Madai,\r\nJavan, Tubal, Meshech, and Tiras were the people who bear their names as\r\ndescendants of Japheth. Furthermore, two years after the flood, Shem who probably\r\nwas the oldest son of Noah had a son whose name was Arphaxad. He also had other\r\nchildren (v. 11) at the age of 500. Terah also was the father of Abram, Nahor and\r\nHaran. Nevertheless, God chose Abram from the family of Shem as the recipient\r\nthrough whom He would fulfil His covenant. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> Every family on planet earth has an origin. No individual on earth exists in\r\nisolation. We all have our lineage just like Noah had several descendants through his\r\nthree children. Noteworthy is the fact that the covenant God made with Noah was\r\nfrom one generation to another. In other words, it is continuous. However, Christians\r\nshould remember that we are heirs of the covenant of God through Jesus Christ.\r\nTherefore, everyone who accepts Jesus as Saviour and Lord becomes a recipient of\r\nthe new covenant and heirs with Him. This presupposes the fact that one does not\r\nnecessarily need to be born a Jew in order to partake in the covenant but be saved\r\nthrough faith in Jesus Christ. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> Let the class members mention some significant events in their family probably\r\nfrom the last four decades. <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\r\n        <li> Discuss how family background can influence their children's life decisions. <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\r\n   \r\n        <\/ol>\r\n\r\n        <\/li>\r\n\r\n<li>\r\n        \r\n        <h5> Terah and His Family Relocate\r\nGenesis 11:31-32 <\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> Noah had a long and great family background. From verses 10 to 26 we have the\r\nrecord of the genealogy of Shem, the oldest son of Noah. At the age of 70, Terah\r\nbecame the father of Abram, Nahor and Haran. He led his family to relocate towards\r\nCanaan, the land God later promised and gave to Abraham and his descendants.\r\nAlthough the reason for the relocation is not stated, the Scripture says that after a\r\nwhile, Terah decided to relocate from the city of Ur of the Chaldeans to the land of\r\nCanaan. He left with his son Abram, grandson Lot and his daughter in-law Sarai (the\r\nwife of Abram). According to verse 31, they went as far as Haran and lived there until\r\nhis death at the age of 205. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> It is evident from the passage that God entered into a covenant relationship\r\nwith Noah and his family after the flood and this covenant continues throughout all\r\ngenerations.

God places great importance on His\r\ntiming and ultimately decides through whom He will achieve His purpose.

The call was with the\r\ncommand to leave his country, people and his father\\'s household to an unknown\r\ndestination, which He promised to show him (v. 1). The call came with different\r\npromises. For instance, from verse 2 to 4, God promised to:\r\n        <\/p><ul>\r\n        <li> Make him into a great nation and to bless him. <\/li>\r\n        <li> Make his name great among the nations so that he will be a blessing. <\/li>\r\n        <li> Bless those who bless him as well as curse those who curse him. <\/li>\r\n        <li> All people on earth will be blessed through him. <\/li>\r\n        <\/ul>\r\n <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> According to verse 4, Abram left as commanded by God; with his wife, Sarai\r\nand cousin, Lot at the age of seventy-five. Although God's call to Abram to go to an\r\nunknown place looks incomprehensible from human perspective; his quick response\r\nis amazing. He promptly acted in faith and left as instructed by God. Little wonder the\r\nauthor of Hebrews credited him for his faith. This singular step, therefore, has made\r\nAbram the progenitor of a new community through which God has brought about\r\nsalvation to humankind. It marked the beginning of God's new covenant relationship\r\nwith him. By implication, God's dealing with Abram was a move towards saving\r\nhumanity, culminating in the coming of the Messiah from the lineage of Abraham\r\n(Matthew 1). Of course, God is still in the business of calling His people as a way of\r\nreaching the whole world for Him through Jesus Christ. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> Discuss how the whole world has benefitted from the covenant of God with\r\nAbram. <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\r\n        <li> How can believers be recipients of God's blessing to Abram? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\r\n        <li> What are some of the things people consider difficult to leave in order to follow\r\nJesus? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 3-->\r\n        <\/ol>\r\n\r\n        <\/li>\r\n        \r\n        <\/ol>\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h4> Prayer Points <\/h4>\r\n        <ul>\r\n        <li> Thank God who has extended His covenant of salvation to you through His Son,\r\nJesus Christ. <\/li> <!-- Prayer Point 1-->\r\n        <li> Pray that God will enable you to be part of His instruments to win souls into His\r\ncovenant relationship. <\/li> <!-- Prayer Point 2-->\r\n        <li> Ask God to help you to be a good example of faith in Christ to your children and\r\nrelatives. <\/li> <!-- Prayer Point 3-->\r\n        <\/ul>\r\n\r\n             <h4> Fellowship and Ministry Building Activities <\/h4>\r\n        <ul>\r\n        <li> Class members should write at least five reasons they would not have answered the call\r\nof God at the age of Abram when God called him to leave his family to a new place. <\/li> <!-- Fellowship Activity 1-->\r\n       \r\n        <\/ul>\r\n\r\n           <h4> Take Home <\/h4>\r\n        \r\n        <ul>\r\n        \r\n        <li> God rewards faithfulness at all times. <\/li> <!-- Take Home 1-->\r\n        <li> Total obedience to God attracts divine blessings. <\/li> <!-- Take Home 2-->\r\n        <li> Family background can serve as a catalyst or impediment to one's relationship with God. <\/li> <!-- Take Home 2-->\r\n        <li> We should be ready to answer God's call at all times. <\/li> <!-- Take Home 2-->\r\n        <li> Christians should be good examples of the faith to the people around them. <\/li> <!-- Take Home 2-->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <\/ul><\/p>"},{"id":"43","title":"ABRAHAM AND SARAH BIRTH GOD'S PEOPLE","message":"<p><center>\r\n\r\n            <h4> October 21, 2018 <\/h4> <!--DATE-->\r\n            <h3> ABRAHAM AND SARAH BIRTH GOD'S PEOPLE <\/h3> <!--TOPIC-->\r\n\r\n        <p>\r\n        <p> Devotional Reading: Luke 1:26-38 <\/p> <!--Devotional Reading Passage-->\r\n        <p> Background Scripture \/ Lesson Scripture: Genesis 18:9-15; 21:1-7 <\/p> <!-- Background Scipture Passage-->\r\n       \r\n        <\/p>\r\n\r\n        <h4>Golden Text<\/h4>\r\n\r\n        <p> Now the LORD was gracious to Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did for Sarah\r\nwhat he had promised.\r\n<b>Genesis 21:1<\/b> <\/p> <!-- Golden Text; Make Sure the scripture passage is made bold-->\r\n\r\n<\/center>\r\n\r\n        <h4>Objectives :<\/h4>\r\n        <p>By the end of the lesson, class members should be able to:<\/p>\r\n\r\n        <ul>\r\n        <li> Distinguish between the promises of\r\nGod and that of humankind. <\/li>   <!-- Objective 1-->\r\n        <li> Discuss the joys as well as the\r\nresponsibilities associated with\r\nparenting. <\/li>   <!-- Objective 2-->\r\n        <li> Learn to trust in God even when God\r\ndelays to answers their prayers. <\/li>   <!-- Objective 3-->\r\n        <\/ul>\r\n\r\n        <h4>INTRODUCTION<\/h4>\r\n        <p> Barrenness has always been a\r\nmajor challenge even among\r\nChristian couples, particularly in\r\nthe African setting. Sadly, women are\r\nmostly blamed for their inability to\r\nconceive even when it defies medical\r\nexplanation. Such was the story of Mr\r\nand Mrs Isaac Obodo who have been\r\nmarried for twenty-five years without\r\nany child. As a result of this, Mrs Ruth\r\nObodo has been summoned to several\r\nfamily meetings and has been asked\r\nsome questions she could not provide answers to. After much threat, she was asked to come to the village to perform some\r\nrituals and take some native herbs. But the couple refused to compromise their faith\r\ndespite pressure from friends and parents. Even though they have suffered shame and\r\nreproach, they resolved to continue to trust God to bless them with children.\r\nHowever, during the period of waiting, God continually assured them that they will\r\nhave children of their own and this made them more courageous. Some time later, the\r\nwoman got pregnant and gave birth to a set of twins according to the promise of God\r\nfor them. The naming ceremony attracted people from all walks of life while the news\r\nbecame the headline in most of the national dailies. <\/p>  <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n\r\n        <p> Today's lesson focuses on the story of Abraham and Sarah, the parents of Isaac.\r\nThe study is centred on how God blessed them; having waited for a period of twenty\r\nfive years, after the promise of a son to them was made. The story emphasises two\r\nimportant facts: (1) that God does everything at His own appointed time, especially\r\nfor those who trust in Him like Abraham and Sarah. (2) With God all things are\r\npossible for those that believe. Even though Sarah doubted God's promise because of\r\nher age, God was faithful to His promise. <\/p>  <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n\r\n        \r\n        <h4>THE LESSON EXPLAINED<\/h4>\r\n\r\n        <ol type=\"A\">\r\n\r\n        <li>\r\n        \r\n        <h5> The Promise of a Son to Abram and Sarah\r\nGenesis 18:9-15 <\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> God had earlier promised to give Abraham a son through his wife Sarah so that she\r\nwill be the mother of all nations; and kings of people will come from her. Precisely,\r\nthe son\u2019s would be called Isaac (Genesis 17:16, 19). The preceding verses of chapter\r\n18 have the account of the three visitors who met Abraham by the tree of Mamre.\r\nWorthy of note is Abraham\\'s warm reception and hospitality towards the men, even\r\nthough he did not know they were angels sent to him (vv. 3-8). The plan of God to\r\nbless the couple with a son was again confirmed. But just as Abraham laughed in the\r\nprevious encounter with God (Genesis 17:17), Sarah also laughed at the possibility of\r\nher having children at her old age. Standing quietly at the entrance of the tent, she\r\nsaid, \u201cAfter I am worn out, and my master is old, will I now have this pleasure?\u201d In\r\nfact, Sarah reasoned like every other woman would have reasoned because of the\r\ndifficulty of bearing children at old age. Nevertheless, the response of the angel was\r\nremarkable. He said, \u201cIs anything too hard for the Lord?\u201d (v. 14) In other words,\r\nthere is nothing God cannot do including procreation, notwithstanding the age.\r\nSimilarly, the same affirmation of God\\'s limitless power was made known when the\r\nangel visited Mary, the mother of Jesus (Luke 1: 37). <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> God is capable of doing whatever He wants to do without any barrier. Of course,\r\nbarrenness in those days was seen as a curse from God. Sarah seem to have given up\r\non child-bearing thus she doubted the possibility of the pronouncement and laughed.\r\nIt was the same attitude that compelled her to make Abraham have a child through her\r\nmaid, Hagar. Even though she laughed, she was afraid to admit that she doubted God's promise and power (v. 15). However, God still showed mercy by fulfilling His\r\npromise. God's reply to her shows that with humans, many things may be impossible\r\nbut with God all things are possible. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> Why do some people find it difficult to believe God's promises? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\r\n        <li> What would have been your response to the promise of having a child at old age if\r\nyou were Sarah? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\r\n        <li> Discuss the place of hospitality in receiving God's promise. <!-- Discussion Question 3-->\r\n        <\/li><\/ol>\r\n\r\n        <\/li>\r\n\r\n <li>\r\n        \r\n        <h5> The Birth of Isaac\r\nGenesis 21:1-7 <\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> One of the things that distinguish God from humankind is His ability to keep His\r\npromises. When the set time came, God\\'s promise to Abraham and Sarah was\r\nfulfilled. God visited Sarah, she conceived and bore a son to Abraham and they named\r\nhim Isaac, which in Hebrew language means 'He laughs'. In fact, the joy and\r\nexcitement of his parents at his birth is reflected in this name. She said in verse 6,\r\n\u201cGod has brought me laughter, and everyone who hears about it will laugh with me.\u201d\r\nIsaac was circumcised when he was eight days old in accordance with the covenant\r\nbetween God and Abraham (Genesis 17:6-14). Sarah's testimony was based on the\r\nfact that no one expected that she would ever nurse a child for her husband Abraham,\r\nyet she has borne a son in her old age (v. 7). The climax of the testimony is that\r\nAbraham was a hundred years old when Isaac was born (v. 5). Ultimately, not only\r\nwas Sarah happy but those around her were also joyful at the fulfilment of God's\r\npromise to the couple. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> The birth of Isaac, unlike Ishmael, was God's doing (Galatians 4:21-28).\r\nThrough this promised child and his descendants, God will keep His covenant\r\nwith Abraham, which suggests the supernatural aspect of his conception and\r\nbirth. Although the fulfilment of the promise took twenty-five years, what is\r\nimportant is its fulfilment at the appointed time. Undoubtedly, the miracle was\r\nfor God's name to be glorified and to make people believe that God still works\r\nmiracles in the lives of His people. Therefore, waiting couples should be\r\nencouraged to continue to trust in God for His miracles, no matter how long it\r\nwill take God to fulfil His promises. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> Some people believe that the era of miracles and supernatural intervention has\r\npassed.

He was blessed in every way\r\naccording to the promise of God to him. Because Isaac had grown up to a\r\nmarriageable age thus Abraham, his father, compelled his chief servant to swear an\r\noath to get a wife for Isaac among his people (24:1-10), and that he would not get a\r\nwife for his son from among the Canaanites. The servant demonstrated obedience\r\nand, thereafter, embarked on the journey to the town of Nahor. He was specific in his\r\nprayer to God for His guidance in the choice of a wife for Isaac. Although he was not\r\ngiven specifications about the type of woman but the servant acknowledged the\r\nimportance of prayers in accomplishing the task. He, therefore, prayed and said, O\r\nLORD, God of my master Abraham, give me success today, and kindness to my master\r\nAbraham.\" (v. 12) Thereafter, he asked for a sign to validate his choice of a wife for his\r\nmaster's son, Isaac. He stood beside the spring to see the daughters of the townspeople\r\nas they came to fetch water. Verse 16 describes Rebekah as very fair looking and a\r\nvirgin who came to fill her pitcher from the well. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> The place of prayer of faith cannot be underestimated. The prayer offered by the\r\nservant was to enable him know the perfect will of God in marriage for his master's\r\nson. By doing so, he exemplified loyalty and faithfulness to his master, and faith and\r\nabsolute trust in God. He was committed to the assignment entrusted to him by his\r\nmaster and at the same time trusted God to accomplish the task on his behalf. He knew\r\nhe could not succeed without God so he prayed and asked for guidance and success in\r\nthe journey. The servant understood the fact that human wisdom or experience cannot\r\nguarantee success or breakthrough if God is not involved. In fact, this is an attestation\r\nthat when we pray with faith concerning anything according to the will of God, He\r\nhears and gives us success (James 5:15-16). <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> What is your view about asking for signs before you take any decision? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\r\n        <li> Describe Abraham's servant, according to the passage of today <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\r\n        \r\n        <\/ol>\r\n\r\n        <\/li>\r\n\r\n <li>\r\n        \r\n        <h5> The Servant Receives Answer to Prayer\r\nGenesis 24:17-21 <\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> The servant's earnest prayer for a successful journey received an immediate answer.\r\nImmediately after his prayer, he saw Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel, who was the\r\nson of Abraham's brother Nahor and his wife Milcah. She came to fetch water from the\r\nwell. Probably as directed by God, he approached her and said, \u201cGive me to drink; I\r\npray thee, a little water from thy pitcher.\u201d (v. 27) Even though she was unaware of the\r\nservant's mission, Rebekah demonstrated generosity and was respectful. She hastily\r\nemptied her pitcher of water for the servant and also offered to give water to all his\r\ncamels. However, the servant watched carefully to ascertain whether his prayers had\r\nbeen answered. God is indeed a prayer answering God. The servant's journey was\r\nmade successful.

The fact that Abraham's servant asked for a sign to determine God's\r\nwill, which eventually came to pass should not be a precondition for prayer. The Bible\r\ncategorically states that people pray without receiving answers because such prayers\r\nwere not offered according to the will of God.

Rebekah gave\r\nher consent to follow the servant (v. 58). Therefore, immediately after the marriage\r\nrite had been perfected, the servant sought for permission to go with Rebekah to his\r\nmaster, Abraham. As it was their custom, Rebekah and two of her maids embarked on\r\nthe journey to Canaan. The discourse between Rebekah and the servant in verses 64\r\nand 65 was another confirmation that she was actually God's will for Isaac. Finally,\r\nIsaac brought Rebekah, his newly wedded wife, to the tent of his mother Sarah. He\r\nloved her and he was comforted after the death of his mother. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> Worthy of note in the passage is Rebekah's decision to go with the man in order to\r\nbecome Isaac's wife. The decision exemplifies two things: her faith in God who had chosen her as an heir to the covenant and her willingness to submit to the will of God\r\nand followed the servant to Canaan. Thereafter, Isaac and Rebekah became co-heirs to\r\nthe covenant God had made with Abraham. Faith in God and the willingness to do His\r\nwill are two major keys to relating and receiving divine favour. The example of\r\nRebekah should be emulated by believers in their relationship with God, no matter\r\nhow difficult the decision seems. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> Should Christians be involved in match-making marriages?

He was the promised child\r\nborn when Abraham and Sarah were already old according to God's plan for them\r\n(Genesis 21:1ff). When Isaac was forty years old, he married Rebekah, the daughter\r\nof Bethuel (an Aramean from Mesopotamia) and sister of Laban. According to verse\r\n21, Rebekah had no child for about twenty years, and to be barren in those days was\r\na sign of God's wrath on an individual. Isaac who was more spiritually sensitive to\r\nwhat God can do prayed on behalf of his wife. God answered his prayer as Rebekah\r\nbecame pregnant. She was going to have a set of twins but before their birth, they\r\nstruggled against each other in the womb. Upon their mother's inquiry, the Lord said\r\nto her, \u201cTwo nations are in your womb and two peoples from within you will be\r\nseparated; one people will be stronger than the other, and the older will serve the\r\nyounger\u201d (v. 23). Some Bible scholars have concluded that the enmity between\r\nIsraelites and Edomites can be traced to the birth of these twin brothers. Apostle\r\nPaul also attested to this when he stated that before they were born, God had already\r\npreferred Jacob to Esau (Romans 9:11-13). Apparently, two things are revealed in this\r\npassage:\r\n        <\/p><ul>\r\n        <li> Isaac's spiritual sensitivity. He identified the problem and the right solution thus\r\nhe prayed and asked God for intervention. The testimony is that his prayer was\r\nanswered and Rebekah became pregnant.

According to God's promise, when the time came,\r\nRebekah gave birth to two boys with different features. The first that came out was red\r\nand his body was hairy thus, he was named Esau (a Hebrew name with the meaning\r\n\u201chairy\u201d. But his brother was born with his hand holding Esau's heel, and so he was\r\nnamed Jacob\u201d (v .26). They both grew up and chose their different occupations. The\r\nScripture says that Esau was a skilful hunter and loved outdoor life. In other words, he\r\nwas a man of the open country who moved from one place to another for game\r\nhunting. But his brother Jacob was quiet and prefers to stay at home. Division and\r\ndisunity started in the home when their parents began to show their preferences.\r\nWhile Isaac preferred Esau because he enjoyed eating his game, Rebekah preferred\r\nJacob probably because of his availability to help her do some domestic chores. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n        \r\n         <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> Discuss the implications of parental favouritism among siblings.

According to verse 29, one day, Jacob was\r\npreparing some stew when his brother Esau returned from hunting probably tired and,\r\nof course, hungry and could not immediately make anything for himself. Presumably,\r\nhe was relieved when he saw his brother cooking. Therefore, he said to him, \u201cQuick!\r\nLet me have some of that red stew! I am famished\u201d Ordinarily, one would expect\r\nJacob to empathise and willingly give him some food to quench his hunger but the\r\nreverse was the case. Instead, he requested Esau's birthright in exchange for a plate of\r\nfood. He said to his brother, \u201cFirst sell me your birthright\u201d (v. 31). Despite Esau's\r\nrepeated explanation that he was hungry, Jacob demanded that he should swear an oath\r\nin order to make the transaction of the sale of his birthright authentic. Unfortunately,\r\nEsau swore an oath and sold his birthright for temporary satisfaction. Suffice to say that\r\nin ancient times, birthright included the inheritances of a first born son. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> From this passage, it is possible that Jacob was preparing Esau's favourite meal\r\nbecause the name later used for the descendant of Esau \u201cEdom\u201d was from the\r\nmeaning \u201cred\u201d. It is also probable that Esau exaggerated his hunger so much that he\r\nsaid, \u201c... I am about to die, after all, what good is the birthright to me.\u201d (v. 32)\r\nApparently, Esau did not take his birthright seriously. So, he willingly sold his\r\nbirthright to his brother Jacob even with an oath. He, however, did not realise what he\r\nhad given up until it was too late (Hebrews 12:16-17). Therefore, Jacob who is known\r\nas a schemer took undue advantage of Esau\u2019s weakness to rob him of his birthright and\r\nposition. The summary of this lesson is that Christians should not be gluttons who are ready to\r\ndo anything for the sake of what they will eat. We should also not despise our positions for the\r\npleasure of a moment only to later regret our action. More importantly, we should not be\r\ncareless with our God-given heritage for any reason that may cause regret and sorrow. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> Esau failed to protect his birthright.

Of course, he had intended to sell the house and start a business with the\r\nmoney. But unfortunately, he was deceived by his so-called customer who paid him in\r\nfake dollars. <\/p>  <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n\r\n        <p> Deception, according to Encarta Dictionary is \u201cthe practice of deliberately\r\nmaking somebody believe things that are not true\u201d. It could be in terms of information\r\nintended to deceive or to mislead somebody in order to get something from them.\r\nSuch people are crafty as they deceive their fellow human beings by making them\r\nbelieve things that are not true in order to achieve their intended plans. The focal point\r\nof today's lesson is how Rebekah masterminded a plan for Jacob to deceive Isaac, his\r\nfather, so that he will get what belonged to his twin brother, Esau. <\/p>  <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n\r\n        \r\n        <h4>THE LESSON EXPLAINED<\/h4>\r\n\r\n        <ol type=\"A\">\r\n\r\n        <li>\r\n        \r\n        <h5> Rebekah's Deceptive Plan\r\nGenesis 27:5-10 <\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> Jacob had cunningly taken the birthright of his brother Esau and was probably waiting\r\nfor the death of their father to inherit his property. When Isaac became old and his eyes\r\nwere weak, he called his beloved and first born son, Esau to prepare his favourite meal\r\nfor him so that he would bless him before he dies (v. 1-4). Rebekah quietly listened to\r\nIsaac's conversation with Esau about his intention to bless him before he died.\r\nConsequently, she deceitfully devised a plan for Jacob to receive the intended\r\nblessing from their father Isaac when Esau had gone hunting. In verses 9 and 10, she\r\ntold Jacob to get two young goats to prepare a meal so that Isaac will eat and\r\npronounce his last blessing on him. Undoubtedly, Rebekah's desire was to help God\r\nso that His plan for Jacob will be accomplished (Genesis 23:23). By implication, she\r\nknew the favourite food of her husband and so volunteered to prepare it. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> Meanwhile, Jacob had already bought his brother's birthright and now wants to\r\nget his father's blessing to validate the transfer and eventually become stronger than\r\nEsau, in accordance with the earlier prediction about him. It is obvious that Jacob\r\nearnestly desired the birthright of his brother as a channel through which God's\r\npromise of blessing to him will be fulfilled. He would probably, have obtained it\r\nthrough other means. In addition, Isaac's planned blessing to Esau was against what\r\nGod revealed to Rebekah before the boys were born. On the other hand, Esau who\r\nwhole-heartedly accepted the plan to receive his father's blessing acted contrary to the\r\noath he earlier swore to his brother (Genesis 25:23, 33). Similarly, Rebekah did not\r\nmake any reference to God's earlier revelation but chose to be deceptive in order to\r\nbring God's plan to fulfilment. Isaac also relied on his senses, which failed him so\r\nmuch that he could not distinguish between Jacob and Esau. In reality, we do not need\r\nto help God to accomplish His plans for us. We only need to cooperate with Him and\r\nHis plans will be fulfilled concerning us. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> According to the lesson, what do you think Isaac did not do well? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\r\n        <li> What is the general motive behind deception and how does it relate to Rebekah's\r\nplan? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\r\n        <li> Can anyone help God?

According to verse 18, Jacob went to his father Isaac disguised as Esau. In\r\nhis attempt to convince his father, he said, \u201cI am Esau, your firstborn. I have done as\r\nyou told me. Please sit up and eat some of my game so that you may give me your\r\nblessing.\u201d Unfortunately, Isaac was already old and \u201chis eyes were weak that he could\r\nno longer see (v. 1). <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> The influence and negative role of Rebekah in the life of her beloved son, Jacob, in\r\ntheir effort to help God accomplish His purpose for him is glaring. Jacob followed his\r\nmother's instructions to the point of wearing Esau's clothes so that their father, Isaac, will\r\nnot know his true identity. Although he finally recognised the voice as that of Jacob, it\r\nwas not enough evidence to confirm his suspicion because his sense organs were weak\r\nexcept his ears. However, it should be noted that Isaac's blessing as it is used in this\r\ncontext is different from the birthright, which has to do with spiritual destiny. Christians\r\nshould be reminded that there is no one that cannot be deceived, especially in this corrupt\r\nworld in which the syndrome of get rich quick is the order of the day. The only antidote is\r\nconstant prayer, spiritual alertness and discernment. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> Isaac was deceived by Rebekah and Jacob.

According to\r\nher, her parents were deceived with fake\r\ndocuments for her to travel the United\r\nKingdom to serve as a housemaid to a\r\nclose family member. With joy and\r\nexcitement, her parents agreed with the\r\npeople without seeking for her consent or\r\npraying for divine direction. Although\r\nshe reluctantly accepted the offer, she lost her peace for some days. One day, she dreamt and was strictly warned by God not to\r\nembark on the journey, in spite of the fact that her parents had made necessary\r\npreparations. Even though her refusal to embark on the journey caused trouble\r\nbetween her and her parents, she did not mind because of the warning. Some months\r\nlater, news reached her parents about some of the girls who died in the desert in their\r\nattempt to cross over to Italy while others who survived were forced into prostitution\r\nwithout any option. <\/p>  <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n\r\n        <p> According to Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary, dreams are series of\r\nimages, events and feelings that happen in the mind when one is asleep. But from the\r\nbiblical perspective, dreams and visions are some ways through which God speaks to\r\nHis people, right from the Old Testament times. They have always been means\r\nthrough which messages of warnings, blessings or future events are conveyed from\r\nGod to specific people through His prophets and priests. However, we should know\r\nthat God-given dreams are always with clear message(s). Today's lesson focuses on\r\nJacob's dream which was the beginning of his new relationship with God despite his\r\npast impiety over his brother, Esau. <\/p>  <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n\r\n        \r\n        <h4>THE LESSON EXPLAINED<\/h4>\r\n\r\n        <ol type=\"A\">\r\n\r\n        <li>\r\n        \r\n        <h5> Jacob's Dream\r\nGenesis 28:10-15 <\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> As we studied last week, Jacob connived with his mother, Rebekah, to deceive his\r\nfather, Isaac, to bless him instead of his brother Esau after taking his birthright. Of\r\ncourse, Esau became angry and planned to kill him. When their mother sensed danger,\r\nshe quickly encouraged Jacob to leave Beersheba at once and flee to Haran (her\r\nbrother's city) in Mesopotamia where he lived for about 20 years. The decision was\r\nalso to prevent him from marrying from among the Canaanite women like his brother\r\nEsau. Without doubt, his life was characterised by hopelessness, fear and insecurity.\r\nSo, having travelled about forty-eight miles from Beersheba, a journey too long for a\r\nday, he became tired. Therefore, when the sun had set and he could not proceed in the\r\njourney, he laid down to sleep using a stone as pillow to support his head. According to\r\nverse 12, he had a dream and saw three things: \r\n        <\/p><ul>\r\n        <li> A stairway resting on the earth and the top reaching to the heavens. This can be\r\ninterpreted as a connection between the heaven and earth, between God and\r\nhuman beings. It can also be likened to Jesus as the link between humanity and\r\nheaven (John 14:6). <\/li>\r\n        <li> Angels of God were ascending and descending on the ladder (v. 12c); this\r\nprobably represents God's presence. <\/li>\r\n        <li> The Lord stood above it. He spoke and reaffirmed the promises He made with\r\nJacob's forebears (Genesis 12:3). The climax of the dream experience was God\\'s\r\npromise of His ever abiding presence with him. He also promised to watch over\r\nhim wherever he goes and to bring him back to the land. <\/li>\r\n        <\/ul>\r\n  <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> God can use any means to reveal Himself to humankind either through a dream,\r\nvision, nature, happenings, crisis and many other ways. Obviously, Jacob's dream\r\nexperience was very significant. The things he saw in his dream signified the presence\r\nof God, which marked the beginning of his new relationship with Him despite his past\r\nwicked acts towards his brother, Esau. Notably, the encounter was with an assertion of\r\nblessing of prosperity, fulfilment of divine purpose and covenant which God had\r\nmade to Abraham and Isaac. God also promised His presence and protection in all his\r\nways and to bring him back safely to the land where he slept and had the vision. God\r\nalways makes provision for humans to have a new relationship with Him. Ultimately,\r\nJesus is the connecting bridge between the heaven and earth and the Mediator between\r\nGod and humankind. Therefore, we should know that life cannot be meaningful\r\nwithout an encounter with Him. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> Describe Jacob's state of mind in the course of his journey. <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\r\n        <li> What is the significance of the three things Jacob saw in his dream? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\r\n        <li> Jacob's decision to run was a blessing.

Consequently, when he woke up after the\r\ndream, he affirmed with certainty that he had met with the Lord. He said, \u201cSurely the\r\nLord is in this place, and I was not aware of it.\u201d (v. 16b) Of course, this statement\r\nconfirms his awareness of God's presence where he slept. However, he was\r\noverwhelmed with fear and declared, \u201cHow awesome is this place! This is none other\r\nthan the house of God; this is the gate of heaven.\u201d Indeed, the awesomeness of his\r\nexperience motivated him to do something the next morning. He took the stone that\r\nwas under his head and set it up as a commemorative plaque. He dedicated it to God by\r\npouring oil on it and naming the place Bethel, which means \u201cHouse of God\u201d even\r\nthough it was initially known as Luz. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> Jacobs encounter with God was a special and memorable one. We can see that\r\nafter this experience, he became a changed man though still with flaws but with new\r\nand genuine faith in the God of his fathers. After all, he never expected such a special\r\nencounter with God, being a fugitive. How often do Christians demonstrate ignorance\r\nof God's presence and protection, especially when faced with challenges? Instead of\r\ninstant judgment on Jacob for his wickedness against his brother, God chose to enter\r\ninto a new relationship with him, even though he was frustrated, hopeless and dejected. He was transformed into a man of faith in God throughout his service to\r\nLaban and beyond. God always loves to use the weak and foolish people of this world\r\nto put to shame the so-called wise and strong people of the world (1 Corinthians 1:27-\r\n29). <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> What are some things you think Christians can do as memorial to God for His\r\nfaithfulness? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\r\n        <li> Considering this passage, what should be our attitude towards wicked people? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\r\n       \r\n        <\/ol>\r\n\r\n        <\/li>\r\n        \r\n        <li>\r\n        \r\n        <h5> Jacob Made a Vow\r\nGenesis 28:20-22 <\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> Jacob's response to God's promises to bless him and his offspring exceedingly (vv. 13-\r\n15) on his way to Haran is remarkable. He made a vow as part of his commitment to\r\nGod who has promised to fulfil His promise to him. He said, \u201cIf God will be with me\r\nand watch over me on this journey I am taking and will give me food to eat and clothes\r\nto wear so that I return safely to my father's house, then the LORD will be my God ...\u201d\r\n(vv. 20-21). He also vowed that the stone which he has set up as a memorial of his\r\nmeeting with God will be God's house and out of his possession, he will give one\r\ntenth. This declaration was a way of acknowledging the Lord as his God, King,\r\nProtector and Provider. Jacob's vow is seen by some scholars as a bargain with God:\r\nHe said, If God does this, then I will do that, while others see it as more of concession.\r\nIn other words, Jacob meant that because God will fulfil His promise to him then he\r\nwill respond in three ways: the Lord will be his God, he will make a place of worship\r\nfor God where the stone is set up and he will give a tenth of all his earnings to Him. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> The climax of today's lesson is that Jacob's singular experience changed everything\r\nabout him. Therefore, there are basic lessons to learn from Jacob's commitment to the\r\nnew relationship with God 1). He surrendered his life to God and vowed to serve the God\r\nof his fathers. In fact, an encounter with God is usually a life-transforming because it is\r\nnot possible for one to encounter God and remain the same. 2). He made the worship of\r\nGod his primary focus. 3). He vowed to give to God a tenth of all his blessings. These\r\nthree things are very important if we will truly respond to God's invitation to a new\r\nrelationship. Just like Jacob set up a memorial to acknowledge God, believers can buy\r\nBibles, plant churches, buy evangelism vehicles or form prayer groups to serve as\r\nmemorials as our salvation experience of God's mighty works in our lives. Supposedly,\r\nour lives as Christians should reflect the glory of God by virtue of the fact that we have\r\nencountered God through the salvation of our souls. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> In what way should we respond to God's invitation to a new relationship and\r\nfellowship? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\r\n        <li> Discuss the importance of making vows to God. <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\r\n        <li> Discuss the relevance of tithing under the new covenant. <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 3-->\r\n        <\/ol>\r\n\r\n        <\/li>\r\n\r\n        <\/ol>\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h4> Prayer Points <\/h4>\r\n        <ul>\r\n        <li> May the promises of God concerning me and my family come to pass, in Jesus'\r\nName. <\/li> <!-- Prayer Point 1-->\r\n        <li> Help me, O God, that I will always enjoy Your presence. <\/li> <!-- Prayer Point 2-->\r\n        <li> Pray that God will renew His covenant relationship with you. <\/li> <!-- Prayer Point 3-->\r\n        <\/ul>\r\n\r\n             <h4> Fellowship and Ministry Building Activities <\/h4>\r\n        <ul>\r\n        <li> Lead the class members to list some of the things they find very difficult to part with\r\nin order to have a new relationship with God. <\/li> <!-- Fellowship Activity 1-->\r\n        <li> They should render a prayer of agreement and ask for the power of the Holy Spirit to\r\nhelp part with such things so that they will begin to enjoy God's favour. <\/li> <!-- Fellowship Activity 2-->\r\n        <\/ul>\r\n\r\n           <h4> Take Home <\/h4>\r\n        \r\n        <ul>\r\n        \r\n        <li> No matter how lonely we are, God's presence is always with us. <\/li> <!-- Take Home 1-->\r\n        <li> Our past experiences do not debar God from using us. <\/li> <!-- Take Home 2-->\r\n        <li> Commit your life and resources to the service of God. <\/li> <!-- Take Home 2-->\r\n        <li> One tenth of your earnings belongs to God and must be dedicated to Him. <\/li> <!-- Take Home 2-->\r\n        <li> Whenever we make vows, we should be ready to fulfil them. <\/li> <!-- Take Home 2-->\r\n        \r\n        <\/ul><\/p>"},{"id":"48","title":"GOD BLESSES JACOB AND RACHEL ","message":"<p><center>\r\n\r\n            <h4> November 25, 2018 <\/h4> <!--DATE-->\r\n            <h3> GOD BLESSES JACOB AND RACHEL <\/h3> <!--TOPIC-->\r\n\r\n        <p>\r\n        <p> Devotional Reading: Psalm 46 <\/p> <!--Devotional Reading Passage-->\r\n        <p> Background Scripture: Genesis 30 <\/p> <!-- Background Scipture Passage-->\r\n        <p> Lesson Scripture: Genesis 30:22-32, 43 <\/p> <!-- Lesson Scipture Passage-->\r\n        <\/p>\r\n\r\n        <h4>Golden Text<\/h4>\r\n\r\n        <p> Then God remembered Rachel; he listened to her\r\nand opened her womb.\r\n<b>Genesis 30:22<\/b> <\/p> <!-- Golden Text; Make Sure the scripture passage is made bold-->\r\n\r\n<\/center>\r\n\r\n        <h4>Objectives :<\/h4>\r\n        <p>By the end of the lesson, class members should be able to:<\/p>\r\n\r\n        <ul>\r\n        <li> Explain God's expectations of\r\nbelievers during waiting period or\r\nwhen they are cheated by someone\r\nthey trust. <\/li>   <!-- Objective 1-->\r\n        <li> Pray for others who are waiting and\r\ntrusting God for the fruit of the womb\r\nin their church. <\/li>   <!-- Objective 2-->\r\n        <li> Determine to be faithful to God and\r\ntheir duties, even when cheated. <\/li>   <!-- Objective 3-->\r\n        <\/ul>\r\n\r\n        <h4>INTRODUCTION<\/h4>\r\n        <p> An English saying goes thus: \u201cHe\r\nwho laughs last, laughs best.\u201d\r\nMr Williams Adams is a senior\r\nlecturer in one of the federal universities\r\nin the country.

Later on, he got\r\nan appointment as a senior lecturer in a private university. His joy knew no bounds\r\nwhen he was made an associate professor with all benefits attached because of his\r\nwealth of experience.

He again demonstrated his\r\ncleverness as he bargained with his father-in-law, Laban, and got the better part of the\r\nlivestock thus he left Haran a rich man. Furthermore, Rachel who also suffered delay\r\nin child-bearing was remembered by God and she became a mother. Today's lesson\r\nfocuses on Jacob's faithfulness and how God blessed him and his wife Rachel in the\r\nland of Haran despite the effort of Laban to cheat and deny him his benefits. <\/p>  <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n\r\n        \r\n        <h4>THE LESSON EXPLAINED<\/h4>\r\n\r\n        <ol type=\"A\">\r\n\r\n        <li>\r\n        \r\n        <h5> God Remembered Rachel\r\nGenesis 30:22-24 <\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> Jacob had worked hard and fulfilled the conditions given by Laban in order to marry\r\nhis two daughters Leah and Rachel. But while Leah had four sons, Rachel did not\r\nhave children of her own. Unfortunately, barrenness in their days was regarded as a\r\ncurse from God and conception, a gift of God. Rachel and her husband Jacob decided\r\nto seek the face of God concerning their need. Eventually, God answered the prayer of\r\nRachel and she became pregnant and gave birth to her first son. With excitement, she\r\ndeclared, \u201cGod has taken away my disgrace. She named him Joseph, and said, \"May the\r\nLORD add to me another son\" (vv. 23b-24). <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> The promises of God will surely come to fulfilment at the appointed time.\r\nThough Rachel experienced delay in child-bearing just like Sarah and Rebekah,\r\nshe had her own children at God's appointed time. Nevertheless, it is apparent\r\nthat she would have suffered reproach, disgrace, and so much ridicule from her\r\nsister, Leah, Jacob\\'s first wife (Genesis 30:14-15) that she requested her husband\r\nto give her children or she died (Genesis 30:1). Finally, God remembered her,\r\nopened her womb and she gave birth. Her statement, \u201cGod has taken away my\r\ndisgrace\u201d (v. 23b) is an indication of the ordeals she would have gone through\r\nduring her waiting period. We can say that God is never late, we only have to be\r\npatient and committed to Him as we wait for answers to our prayers. We also\r\nneed to be persistent in prayer and not lose hope because He who has promised\r\nwill surely bring it to pass. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> What are some ungodly ways people adopt to help themselves out of long-standing\r\nproblems and its implication? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\r\n        <li> What should be the response of believers when God remembers them, having\r\nwaited for God's intervention for a specific request like Rachel in today's passage? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\r\n       \r\n        <\/ol>\r\n\r\n        <\/li>\r\n\r\n<li>\r\n        \r\n        <h5> Jacob Presents His Request before Laban\r\nGenesis 30:25-32 <\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> Jacob had faithfully served Laban, his father-in-law, for several years and according\r\nto verse 27, the Lord blessed Laban for his sake. An old proverb says that no matter\r\nhow long an apprentice serves his master, he must go to serve himself after some time.\r\nAs a result, after the birth of Joseph, Jacob sought permission from Laban to go back\r\nto his hometown together with his wives, children and perhaps with other belongings\r\nfor three reasons:\r\n        <\/p><ul>\r\n        <li> He wanted to go back to his homeland, which he left some years back. After all,\r\nGod had multiplied him with four wives and eleven children. So, having served\r\nLaban for some years, he needed to go back to his homeland and country to start a\r\nnew life with his family. <\/li>\r\n        <li> Jacob had longed to see his parents whom he left at Canaan due to the fear of being\r\nkilled by his brother, Esau. <\/li>\r\n        <li> He was determined to go and settle his family on the land God promised his\r\nancestors. Therefore, he presented his request before Laban and said, \u201cGive me my\r\nwives and children and send me away\u201d (vv. 25-26). Laban, however, persuaded\r\nhim to continue to work for his wages because he knew he was blessed because of\r\nJacob and so, he would not want him to go. Although Jacob was given an\r\nopportunity to bargain his wages, he preferred to have all the speckled or spotted\r\nsheep, every dark coloured lamb and goat (v. 32). By implication, Jacob's choice of\r\nwages was in favour of Laban. <\/li>\r\n        <\/ul>\r\n <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> Laban wanted Jacob to continue to work for him because he (Laban) had become\r\nrich in livestock through Jacob. This is similar to the case of Potiphar whose\r\nhousehold was blessed because of Joseph (Genesis 39:5). But it should be noted that\r\nJacob's desire to continue to keep Jacob as his steward was for selfish reasons. Little\r\nwonder he took undue advantage of him despite his honesty and faithful service to\r\nhim. Interestingly, Jacob did not cheat on Laban. Instead, he served him faithfully and\r\ndiligently. He was honest with him and for this reason God reciprocated his actions\r\nwith surpassing blessings. Believers should not short-change anyone for selfish\r\nreasons because the consequences can be costly. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> What kind of divination do you think Laban consulted to know that he was blessed\r\nbecause of Jacob?

He got some branches of poplar, almond and plane trees and stripped off\r\ntheir bark so that they will become white. He placed them in front of the flocks where\r\nthey drank water, so that when they bred in front of the branches they will produce\r\nyoung ones that are streaked, speckled and spotted. Whenever the healthy animals\r\nwere mating, Jacob would put the branches before them so that they would breed\r\namong the branches. By so doing, he carefully built up his own flock and kept it\r\nseparate from Laban's. Within a short while, Laban had all the weak animals, Jacob\r\nhad the healthy ones. This technique of peeled stick before the flocks in the watering\r\ntroughs was unknown to Laban who lived in Haran. Perhaps, Jacob learnt this system\r\nfrom the shepherds in Canaan where it was commonly used. Gradually, Jacob became\r\nprosperous, owned large flocks, camels, donkeys, maidservants and menservants. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> God decided to bless Jacob despite Laban's deception. From the passage, we\r\ncan see that his honesty paved way for him in spite of Laban's strategy to make him\r\nleave empty-handed. The peeled branches became the instrument God used to bless\r\nJacob and increase his flocks. God is never slack in attending to His children who are\r\nbeing cheated and denied of their rights and entitlement. Jacob used his skill as a\r\nprofessional herdsman, under God's direction, profitably without any trace of\r\ndishonesty to his master, Laban. Christians must know that they can be blessed\r\nwithout necessarily cheating their employers. In fact, such blessings can last and\r\nmany will have the opportunity of enjoying it. Therefore, we are to continually trust\r\nGod for His blessings, be diligent and faithful at work, for divine blessing and uplift. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> Describe the end of those who deceive people in order to enrich themselves.

He had served for a\r\nperiod of about twenty years with records\r\nof achievements as members of the\r\nchurch testified. During his retirement\r\nservice which coincided with the\r\ninduction service for the new pastor,\r\nwhen 'Baba Pastor', as he was fondly\r\ncalled by his members, was asked to give\r\nhis farewell message, he simply\r\nadmonished the members to remain\r\ncommitted to God. He encouraged them\r\nto always obey God, love Him whole-heartedly and teach their children the way of the Lord because it is the pathway to\r\nsuccess in life. Baba's farewell message can be likened to the words of Moses to the\r\npeople of Israel. Having given the Ten Commandments, which was supposed to guide\r\nthem as they prepare to enter the Promised Land, he also reminded them of the\r\nimportance of their love and devotion to God as well as the need to teach their\r\nchildren. <\/p>  <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n\r\n        <p> The word \"love\" is the same as to feel affection for, to worship, or to be devoted to\r\nsomething. Unfortunately today, its usage by some people, especially young ones\r\ndepict that they lack the true understanding of the word. According to Moses, the\r\nIsraelites were expected to love God, demonstrate obedience and show devotion to\r\nHim in the Promised Land so that they will not be influenced by their neighbouring\r\nnations. Today's lesson focuses on God's command through His servant Moses to the\r\nIsraelites to love and obey Him so that they would enjoy His blessings in the Land\r\nwhich He has promised to give to their fathers. <\/p>  <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n\r\n        \r\n        <h4>THE LESSON EXPLAINED<\/h4>\r\n\r\n        <ol type=\"A\">\r\n\r\n        <li>\r\n        \r\n        <h5> The Command to Fear and Obey God\r\nDeuteronomy 6:1-3 <\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> Chapter 6 of the book of Deuteronomy is known to contain series of commandments\r\nfor the children of Israel. Obviously, Moses knew that the Israelites were about to\r\nenter into the Promised Land so, he assembled the Israelites to remind them of the\r\ncommands, decrees and laws which they must obey in the land they were about to\r\npossess. According to verse 2, they were expected to:\r\n        <\/p><ul>\r\n        <li> Fear the Lord and inculcate same to the generations that would live after\r\nthem. Fear for God as it is used in this context means to reverence or\r\nworship God. <\/li>\r\n        <li> Carefully and diligently obey all the commands and decrees He has given\r\nthem. In other words, they were supposed to comply with all the instructions.\r\nMoses made them know that the fear of and obedience to God are the\r\nrequisites for which they will enjoy the blessings, prosperity and protection of\r\nGod in the Promised Land (vv. 2-3). The need for obedience to the laws,\r\ndecrees and commands is repeated in verse 3 when he said to them, \u201cHear, O\r\nIsrael, and be careful to obey so that it may go well with you and that you may\r\nincrease greatly in a land flowing with milk and honey, just as the Lord, the\r\nGod of your fathers, promised you.\u201d (v. 3). <\/li>\r\n        <\/ul>\r\n  <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> The admonition to fear and obey God became necessary because of the tendency to\r\ndrift from God when they get to the Promised Land. In addition, fear and obedience\r\nare the two basic requirements needed in building a relationship with God and\r\nenjoying His blessings (Deuteronomy 28:1-14). Therefore, God repeatedly\r\ninstructed the Israelites on these subjects so that they may live in the land for a long\r\ntime. Similarly, all Christians who intend to relate with God and enjoy His promises of blessings, prosperity, and protection should learn to fear (reverence or worship)\r\nHim. We should obey His commands, notwithstanding how burdensome they seem\r\nbecause this is the pathway to enjoying His blessings. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> Why do some Christians find it difficult to obey God and how do you think we can\r\ncultivate obedience? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\r\n        <li> Discuss the attitudes of contemporary Christians to obedience to God's\r\ncommands. <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\r\n        <li> What roles are expected of parents today to see that their children fear and obey the\r\nLord? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 3-->\r\n        <\/ol>\r\n\r\n        <\/li>\r\n\r\n <li>\r\n        \r\n        <h5> The Oneness of God\r\nDeuteronomy 6:4 <\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> Moses recounted the great history of God's dealings with Israel over the past forty\r\nyears of their experiences in the wilderness which show the inimitability of the God of\r\nIsrael. He, therefore, called them to a life of total obedience to Him as they were about\r\nto enter the Promised Land (Deuteronomy 4). As he continued in his admonition to a\r\nlife of obedience and respect for God, Moses also declared the doctrine of the \"the unity\r\nof God.\" He emphatically said in verse 4, \u201cHear, O Israel: the Lord our God, the Lord is\r\none\u201d. Without doubt, this expression of the unity of God affirms that there is only one\r\nliving and true God who brought them out of Egypt and promised an inheritance for\r\nthem. Apparently, his desire was to remind the Israelites the uniqueness of God and how\r\nto relate with Him when they finally enter the Promised Land. The reminder became\r\nnecessary because the occupants of the land were pagans (Deuteronomy 6:14). He thus\r\nreminded them that the God that brought them out of Egypt is the only true God; He has\r\nno equal or rival. He is self-existent and self-reliant. For that reason, they should not\r\nserve other gods but give their total allegiance to God alone. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> One of the things that distinguish God from humankind is that He is one\r\nindivisible God unlike Baals and other pagan gods of Canaan which have various\r\nforms. In fact, this is not negated by the doctrine of Trinity as upheld by Christians\r\ntoday. God remains one God who manifests as the Father, Son and the Holy Spirit. It is\r\nthe same God who reveals Himself in these forms to carry out specific assignments at\r\nspecific times. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> How will you convince a non Christian that Christians do not serve three Gods\r\nas they assume based on the doctrine of the Trinity? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\r\n        <li> What are those things that can be other 'gods' in the lives of believers and can\r\ncompete with our loyalty to God? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\r\n       \r\n        <\/ol>\r\n\r\n        <\/li>\r\n\r\n <li>\r\n        \r\n        <h5> The Command to Teach Future Generations\r\nDeuteronomy 6:5-9 <\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> Moses' instruction to the people of Israel to love God and be devoted to Him was\r\ncomprehensive. Having spoken on the oneness of God, Moses shifted to the subject of\r\nlove for God. He emphatically said, \u201cLove the Lord your God with all your heart and\r\nwith all your soul and with all your strength.\u201d (v. 5) In other words, such love must be\r\ntotal since it involves one's whole being as an indication of devotion to God. The\r\nimportance of this command is seen in verses 7 to 9 as the parents were admonished to:\r\n        <\/p><ul>\r\n       <li> Teach the commands to love and obey God to their children when they sit, walk,\r\nlie down or get up. <\/li>\r\n       <li> Tie them as symbols on their arms and wear them on their foreheads. <\/li>\r\n       <li> Write them on the doorframes of their houses and gates. <\/li>\r\n       <\/ul> \r\n  <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> The importance of this command for the people of Israel to love the Lord and be\r\ndevoted to Him cannot be overemphasised. Even Jesus said the whole law could be\r\nsummed up in the words of these verses as the greatest commandment (Matthew\r\n22:37-40). The need to tie the commands on their arms, wear and write them on their\r\ndoorframes became necessary because ordinary people had no copy of the law. It was\r\nonly to be taught by words of mouth and the important parts were to be written where\r\nthe people would see and probably master it. Even today, the command to teach our\r\nchildren to love and be devoted to God has placed an important task on parents. It is\r\nthe duty of every Christian parent to see that their children love God, obey and are\r\ndevoted to Him with all sincerity. Love is fundamental in any relationship.

He gave his life to\r\nChrist during a joint village\r\noutreach organised by the youths of\r\nGod's Will Baptist Conference to mark\r\ntheir twentieth anniversary. Mr Salawu\r\ndid not waver despite the persecution\r\nfrom his friends and family members\r\nimmediately he gave his life to Christ. He\r\nserved God with joy, zeal and devotion to\r\na point that he donated his inherited plot of land for the construction of a church building, in his hometown. Unfortunately,\r\nnone of his children was interested in the things of God despite his effort. However,\r\nsometime later, he took ill and was hospitalised for a period of time. On his sick bed,\r\nMr Salawu continued to preach the message of the Gospel to his children. The day he\r\ndied, he prayed and encouraged them to make up their minds on whom they will\r\nserve, whether it is the gods of their forefathers or the Lord Jesus. <\/p>  <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n\r\n        <p> The story of Mr Salawu Bello is similar to the case of Joshua who successfully\r\nled the people of Israel until his old age. Today's lesson focuses on how he summoned\r\nall the tribes of Israel and called them to a renewed covenant relationship with God at\r\nShechem. Having declared his willingness to love and serve God together with his\r\nfamily, Joshua charged the people to forsake other gods and serve the Lord God of\r\nIsrael. According to verse 31, Israel served God throughout the lifetime of Joshua and\r\nthe elders who outlived him, who had experienced everything the Lord had done for\r\nthem as a nation. <\/p>  <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n\r\n        \r\n        <h4>THE LESSON EXPLAINED<\/h4>\r\n\r\n        <ol type=\"A\">\r\n\r\n        <li>\r\n        \r\n        <h5> A Call to a Renewed Covenant\r\nJoshua 24:1-3 <\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> After the death of Moses, the mantle of leadership fell on Joshua to lead God\\'s people\r\nto the Promised Land. God was actually with the people according to His promise to\r\nJoshua on the conquest and division of the land. When Joshua was about to die, he\r\ncalled and reminded the people of God's faithfulness to them and the consequences of\r\ndisobedience to Him (Joshua 23:14-16). To further encourage them to love and serve\r\nGod, he gathered all the tribes of Israel including the elders, judges, the leaders and all\r\nthe officials of Israel to the presence of God at Shechem. Previously, the people of\r\nIsrael had renewed their covenant of obedience to God in Shechem. However, the\r\npurpose of this latter gathering was to reveal God's dealings with their forefather,\r\nAbraham. During the period, God blessed him with many descendants including\r\nIsaac, the promised child. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> Apparently, Joshua's intention of bringing the people together was to make\r\nthem renew their commitment to serve the Lord. When they had assembled, he\r\nrecounted how God dealt kindly with their ancestor, Abraham by calling him out of\r\nidolatry into a new relationship with Him (Genesis 12:1-3). Joshua's recount of the\r\ngreat acts of God in the election of Abraham and his descendants is important as it\r\nserves as (1) a reminder to the people of the goodness of God and (2) the necessity\r\nof keeping His laws and commands. In the New Testament dispensation, God\r\nelected people into His family through the sacrificial death of Jesus Christ. The\r\ngood acts of God to humankind which is already completed through Christ and His\r\nsacrifice can only be appreciated and appropriated as we constantly renew our\r\nallegiance to serve God. Just as Joshua summoned the people, we are daily\r\nreminded by the Holy Spirit to renew our commitment to God through Christ Jesus who has saved us. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li how=\"\" can=\"\" our=\"\" church=\"\" fellowships=\"\" be=\"\" enriched=\"\" to=\"\" help=\"\" individuals=\"\" renew=\"\" their=\"\" commitment=\"\" serve=\"\" and=\"\" obey=\"\" god?=\"\" <=\"\" li=\"\"> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\r\n        <\/li><li> What is the place of group or personal retreat in renewing our commitment to\r\nGod? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\r\n        <li> What does it mean to present oneself before God? v.1b <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 3-->\r\n        <\/ol>\r\n\r\n        <\/li>\r\n\r\n <li>\r\n        \r\n        <h5> A Call to Choose Whom to Serve\r\nJoshua 24:13-15 <\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> Joshua's effort in calling the people into a renewed covenant relationship with God\r\nwas all-encompassing. From verse 5, he carefully gave detailed account of the good\r\ndeeds of God among them beginning from the time He delivered and brought their\r\nfathers out of the land of Egypt. God\u2019s deeds to them include:\r\n        <\/p><ul>\r\n        <li> The destruction of their oppressors (v. 7). <\/li>\r\n        <li> Victories over their attackers in the wilderness (8-10, 11-12). <\/li>\r\n        <li> The miraculous crossing of the Red Sea and Jordan River (vv. 6-7, 11) <\/li> \r\n        <li> Their settlement in the Promised Land (v. 13). <\/li>\r\n        <\/ul>\r\nHe, however, acknowledged the fact that these acts were done by God without\r\ntheir help (v. 12) even though they have been promised by God (Deuteronomy 6:10-\r\n11). Based on these facts, he admonished them to fear the Lord and serve Him\r\nfaithfully. Furthermore, they were encouraged to get rid of their forefather\\'s idols,\r\nwhich they worshipped in Mesopotamia and in Egypt. He finally challenged them to\r\nchoose between serving God or the idols of their forefathers and the Amorites.\r\nNevertheless, in verse 15, he made a public affirmation of his willingness to serve the\r\nLord with his family (v. 25).  <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> As a true leader, Joshua\u2019s heart desire was to see his generation continue to serve\r\nGod and not idols. Today, many things compete for our attention to the detriment of\r\nour total allegiance to God. It could be our career, material possessions, fashions,\r\nacademics, fame, power and so on. As it was in the days of Joshua so it is today.\r\nChristians will need to make a choice whether to allow any of these to replace God in\r\ntheir hearts or hold on to God. After all, Jesus said it is not possible to serve God and\r\nmammon (Matthew 6:24). It is instructive to note that the place of accountability\r\npartner(s) is important in the renewal of Christians' walk with God. This is the same\r\nrole Joshua played among God's people. The challenge, therefore, is our resolution to\r\nrenew our covenant relationship with God, fear Him and chose to serve Him with all\r\nsincerity because of His wonderful deeds among us. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> List some other things in this contemporary time that compete with the place of God in the hearts of people. <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\r\n        <li> What steps can we take to overcome these things and be resolute in serving God? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\r\n        <li> What does the fear of God entail? v.14. <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 3-->\r\n        <\/ol>\r\n\r\n        <\/li>\r\n\r\n <li>\r\n        \r\n        <h5> Re-affirmation to Serve God\r\nJoshua 24:21-24 <\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> Joshua was firm in his admonition to the people to make a choice between serving God\r\nand the idols of their forefathers (vv. 19-20). In verse 21, the people responded\r\naffirmatively. They publicly declared their willingness to serve God. They said to him,\r\n\u201cNo! We will serve the LORD\u201d. Joshua's response to their declaration is also noteworthy.\r\n\u201cYou are witnesses against yourselves that you have chosen to serve the LORD\u201d, he said\r\nto them (v. 22). This, of course, was a normal and authentic part of a treaty or covenant-\r\nmaking in the Old Testament time. Based on their confession and readiness to serve the\r\nLord, he further encouraged them to throw away the inherited gods of their forefathers\r\nand pledge their total allegiance to the Lord, the God of Israel. Their prompt response\r\nwas an indication that they were passionate about the continuity of their relationship\r\nwith the God of their ancestors who had renewed His covenant with them. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> The role of a true and godly leader is seen in Joshua who worked hard and\r\nled the people to make the right decision to serve God and do away with the gods of\r\ntheir forefathers. The people on their part recognised and honoured the words of\r\nJoshua and jointly resolved to serve the Lord. This implies that God's people\r\nshould regularly renew their allegiance to serve and obey God. In addition, we\r\nshould make a passionate resolution to follow Christ and not allow the perils of the\r\npresent age to turn us against God. We should also consciously and openly remind\r\nourselves of such a decision like the people of Israel did because other life's choices\r\nare affected by the decision we make to serve God. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> Discuss some other things you think Christians should discard in order to serve God\r\nfaithfully and obey Him &lt; \/li&gt; <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\r\n        <\/li><li> What role does our confession play in renewing our devotion to God? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\r\n        \r\n        <\/ol>\r\n\r\n        <\/li>\r\n\r\n\r\n        <\/ol>\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h4> Prayer Points <\/h4>\r\n        <ul>\r\n        <li> Every contending force against my attention for God's service is paralysed, in\r\nJesus' Name. <\/li> <!-- Prayer Point 1-->\r\n        <li> Every ungodly choice that causes obstruction in my relationship with God is\r\nremoved today, in the Name of Jesus Christ. <\/li> <!-- Prayer Point 2-->\r\n        <li> I refuse to serve mammon henceforth in the name of Jesus. <\/li> <!-- Prayer Point 3-->\r\n        <\/ul>\r\n\r\n             <h4> Fellowship and Ministry Building Activities <\/h4>\r\n        <ul>\r\n        <li> List some of the programmes organised in your church in recent times that gave\r\nmembers the opportunity to renew their relationship with God <\/li> <!-- Fellowship Activity 1-->\r\n        <li> Class members should renew their commitment to serve God. <\/li> <!-- Fellowship Activity 2-->\r\n        <\/ul>\r\n\r\n           <h4> Take Home <\/h4>\r\n        \r\n        <ul>\r\n        \r\n        <li> Believers should occasionally attend retreats in order to examine their relationship\r\nwith God <\/li> <!-- Take Home 1-->\r\n        <li> Christians should regularly renew their commitment to God. <\/li> <!-- Take Home 2-->\r\n        <li> We should not allow mundane things to affect our sincere love for God. <\/li> <!-- Take Home 2-->\r\n        <li> Each believer should have accountability partner in his\/her spiritual journey. <\/li> <!-- Take Home 2-->\r\n        <li> We should daily resist the temptation to serve other gods. <\/li> <!-- Take Home 2-->\r\n        \r\n        <\/ul><\/p>"},{"id":"51","title":"LOVE AND WORSHIP GOD","message":"<p><center>\r\n\r\n            <h4> December 16, 2018 <\/h4> <!--DATE-->\r\n            <h3> LOVE AND WORSHIP GOD <\/h3> <!--TOPIC-->\r\n\r\n        <p>\r\n        <p> Devotional Reading: Psalm 86:1-7 <\/p> <!--Devotional Reading Passage-->\r\n        <p> Background Scripture \/ Lesson Scripture: Psalm 103:1-17, 21-22 <\/p> <!-- Background Scipture Passage-->\r\n        \r\n        <\/p>\r\n\r\n        <h4>Golden Text<\/h4>\r\n\r\n        <p> As far as the east is from the west, so far has\r\nhe removed our transgressions from us.\r\n<b>Psalm 103:12<\/b> <\/p> <!-- Golden Text; Make Sure the scripture passage is made bold-->\r\n\r\n<\/center>\r\n\r\n        <h4>Objectives :<\/h4>\r\n        <p>By the end of the lesson, class members should be able to:<\/p>\r\n\r\n        <ul>\r\n        <li> Differentiate between thanking God\r\nand praising Him. <\/li>   <!-- Objective 1-->\r\n        <li> State the reasons why children of\r\nGod should praise God. <\/li>   <!-- Objective 2-->\r\n        <li> Express their commitment to God\r\nalways. <\/li>   <!-- Objective 3-->\r\n        <\/ul>\r\n\r\n        <h4>INTRODUCTION<\/h4>\r\n        <p> Mr Jacobson Arubebe is a well-\r\nknown philanthropist whose\r\nimpact has been felt in his\r\nchurch, family and hometown. Many\r\npeople have benefitted from his\r\ngenerosity, especially the youths.\r\nThrough his influence, a multi-national\r\ncompany was established in his\r\nhometown, which made it possible for\r\nmany indigenes to be gainfully\r\nemployed. He single-handedly built a\r\nhealth centre, a town hall and renovated\r\nthe only primary school in the village,\r\nwhich is his alma-mater. The community leaders, who recognised the roles Mr Jacobson had played in the development of the\r\ntown decided to honour and appreciate him without his knowledge. He and his family\r\nmembers were invited to attend a meeting with the elders of the town. Some of his\r\nfriends and associates were also invited to witness the occasion. The essence of the\r\nprogramme was to appreciate Mr Jacobson for his wonderful contributions to the\r\nwell-being of the people. The youths, men and women came out in their traditional\r\nattires and different musical instruments with songs of praises in his honour. <\/p>  <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n\r\n        <p> The focal point of today's lesson is praising God for His mighty deeds among His\r\npeople as declared by David. Just like the community praised and honoured Mr\r\nJacobson for his good deeds, so it is expected of the people of God to always\r\nacknowledge God's wonderful deeds and praise Him. <\/p>  <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n\r\n        \r\n        <h4>THE LESSON EXPLAINED<\/h4>\r\n\r\n        <ol type=\"A\">\r\n\r\n        <li>\r\n        \r\n        <h5> Singing the Praises of God Psalm 103:1-10 <\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> This psalm is one of the seventy-three psalms associated with King David. It is a call\r\nto God\\'s people to praise God. According to verses 1 and 2, the psalmist calls on his\r\nsoul and inmost being to praise God's holy name. In verses 3 to 5, he classifies God\u2019s\r\ndeeds into personal and collective portions. Personal benefits are in terms of\r\nforgiveness, healing, redemption, love and compassion, satisfaction and strength. But\r\nverses 6 to 10 contain the collective benefits the children of God have received that\r\ncall for praising Him. They include works of righteousness and vindication of the\r\noppressed. He reveals His ways and deeds, He is slow to anger and looks\r\ncompassionately on sinners. However, His love and compassion are for those who\r\nfear Him. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> This psalm is an individual's expression of thanksgiving to God for all His\r\nbenefits. It should be noted that thanksgiving is different from praise. While praise is\r\noffered to God simply because of whom He is, thanksgiving is offered in response to\r\nspecific things that God has done. Therefore, every part of the human body should be\r\ninvolved in praising God for the wonders of His love and blessings. In other words,\r\npraising God should be both internal and external and we should not be coerced to do\r\nit. Instead, we should be willing to offer our thanksgiving to God, irrespective of our\r\nsituation. Though it seemed the psalmist was only talking to himself, the challenge to\r\nalways praise God whole-heartedly is for all Christians because of His numerous\r\nbenefits toward us. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> How will you encourage someone who has just lost his\/her job to praise God? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\r\n        <li> Why do people easily forget God's benefits for them? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\r\n        <li> How does God crown us with love and compassion? v. 4. <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 3-->\r\n        <\/ol>\r\n\r\n        <\/li>\r\n\r\n  <li>\r\n        \r\n        <h5> Praising God Thankfully\r\nPsalm 103:11-17 <\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> The psalmist, in this passage, expressed God's love and compassion on His people,\r\nespecially those who fear Him.

God knows how we are formed and He\r\nremembers that we are nothing but dust. The Psalmist likens the days of man to\r\ngrass and a flower that flourishes on the field whose lifespan is short. In\r\nconclusion, he attests to the fact that God's love is with those who fear Him and his\r\nrighteousness is for their children's children (v. 17). <\/li>\r\n        <\/ul>\r\n <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> The summary of the lesson is that while we praise and worship God for who He is,\r\nwe should also thank Him for what He has done.

The promise of sending the\r\nMessiah to the Israelites had taken so\r\nlong. They had waited and perhaps\r\nconcluded that the Messiah was no\r\nlonger coming. They probably forgot that\r\none of the characteristics of God is that\r\nHe keeps His promises unlike humankind who are slack in keeping theirs. However, at the appointed time, God\r\nfulfilled His promise and sent His only begotten Son, Jesus Christ through a virgin\r\nwhose name was Mary. <\/p>  <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n\r\n        <p> Today's lesson centres on Jesus, God\\'s loving promise.

Her\r\nname was Mary. The phrase \u201cin the sixth month\u201d indicates that six months had passed\r\nsince the angel earlier visited Zechariah to announce the birth of their son, John the\r\nBaptist. This time, the same angel was sent to Mary to announce to her that she will\r\nconceive and give birth to a son whose name will be called Jesus (v. 32). Noteworthy\r\nin the passage is the unusual way the angel greeted Mary. He said to her, \u201cGreetings,\r\nyou who are highly favoured! The Lord is with you.\u201d (v. 28) The greeting was strange\r\nto Mary, she was terribly afraid at the appearance of the angel and the greetings.\r\nHowever, the angel calmed her fear. He said to her, \u201cDo not be afraid, Mary, you have\r\nfound favour with God.\" The child Mary would bear shall be called Jesus (v. 31)\r\nbecause He will save His people from their sins.\" (Matthew 1:21). <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> The birth of Jesus marks the fulfilment of God's loving promise to His people.

In other words, He came to\r\nreveal and manifest the love of God for humankind. His life and death are, therefore,\r\nthe expressions of His love for the world (John 3:16).

He was named Jesus and circumcised on the\r\neight day according to the Law of Moses. Forty days after, Mary and Joseph came to\r\nthe temple in Jerusalem for the ceremony of purification and dedication. It was the\r\ncustom for every first born male child to be dedicated to the Lord (v. 23). There was a\r\nman in Jerusalem named Simeon, a righteous and devout Jew (v. 25) who had\r\npatiently waited for the consolation of Israel because the Holy Spirit had revealed to\r\nhim that he would not die until he had seen the promised Messiah (v. 26). \\'The\r\nconsolation of Israel' means the coming of Christ. After all, God promised to send the\r\nMessiah whose emergence would bring the Israelites comfort. Simon took the child in\r\nhis arms and gave thanks to God for fulfilling His promise. He said, \u201cSovereign Lord,\r\nas you have promised, you now dismiss your servant in peace.

There is no other name under\r\nthe heavens through which the salvation of humankind will be made possible except\r\nthrough Jesus Christ.

According to\r\nverse 33, Jesus' parents were amazed at the pronouncement by Simeon about their Son.\r\nSimeon blessed them and said to Mary, \u201cThis child is destined to cause the falling and\r\nrising of many in Israel, and to be a sign that will be spoken against, so that the thoughts\r\nof many hearts will be revealed.

He waited until night but was disappointed when he did not\r\nsee his 'perceived' Jesus. The following day, Jesus came knocking on his door. When\r\nthe man saw Him, he angrily accused Jesus of disappointing him but Jesus smiled and\r\nsaid to him, \u201cThrice, I came to your house yesterday but I was denied entry.\" The man\r\nbroke down in tears as a result of his refusal to attend to the three men who came in\r\ndisguise. <\/p>  <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n\r\n        <p> Throughout Jesus' earthly ministry, He associated with and ministered to the\r\nlowly, the poor and the sick and even those in captivity (Matthew 9:10-11). Today,\r\nmany people claim to love God but this does not reflect in their relationship with their\r\nfellow humans, especially the lowly like the case of the man in the introduction.\r\nNevertheless, Jesus teaches that love for Him should be evident among the members\r\nof His kingdom. To be Christlike, therefore, means to imitate Him, especially in our\r\nrelationship with the weak and helpless around us. Unfortunately, we sometimes feel\r\nindifferent toward people who are calling for our help and attention because of the evil\r\nthat has pervaded our society. As much as we may be justified in the way we feel\r\ntowards such people, God still expects us to minister to the least among them. This is\r\nthe focus of today's lesson. <\/p>  <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n\r\n        \r\n        <h4>THE LESSON EXPLAINED<\/h4>\r\n\r\n        <ol type=\"A\">\r\n\r\n        <li>\r\n        \r\n        <h5> The Day of Separation Predicted\r\nMatthew 25:31-33 <\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> Jesus did not leave His disciples in the dark concerning His second coming. From time\r\nto time, He taught and reminded them of His departure and second coming purposely\r\nto judge the world (Matthew 24:29-31). He had just told the parable of the three\r\nservants in which the unprofitable one was cast into outer darkness for being\r\nunfaithful with the gift of God. This passage, therefore, is a description of exactly\r\nwhat the final judgment will look like. It presents a time when Jesus will gather\r\nnations unto Himself and separate the righteous (sheep) from the unrighteous (goats).\r\nThe godly will be positioned at His right-hand side while the ungodly will be at His\r\nleft-hand side.

The first part of His judgment will be\r\nfor the godly who are on the right-hand side. He will say to them, \u201cCome, you who are\r\nblessed by my Father; take your inheritance, the kingdom prepared for you since the\r\ncreation of the world\u201d (v. 34). Of course, the basis of the commendation is their care\r\nand hospitality to the needy, strangers, prisoners, and outcasts. Then the righteous will\r\nwonder when they ever offered such help to the Master but Jesus will reply, \u201cI tell you\r\nthe truth, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers of mine, you did for\r\nme\u201d (v 40). <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\r\n        \r\n        <p> Jesus recognises every act of kindness we do to others. He considers what they did\r\nto the poor and the downtrodden as being done to Him. Consequently, they will\r\nreceive the commendation and the gift of eternal life. Nevertheless, this is not to\r\nsuggest that the basis of salvation is good works after all, no man receives salvation\r\nthrough good works. It is only by the grace of God through Jesus Christ; appropriated\r\nthrough faith (Romans 10:10-13). Rather, it means that salvation through Jesus Christ\r\nspurs the saved into displaying these godly virtues, especially toward the poor. When\r\none is saved, it is expected that such a person will show kindness, care, and hospitality\r\nto the poor, strangers, hungry, naked and prisoners in our midst.

Even\r\nthough they tried to justify themselves by claiming not to have seen Jesus physically\r\nin need and refused to help, they were cursed and condemned for refusing to serve the\r\nleast among them. The final judgment was the pronouncement of eternal punishment\r\nwithout any opportunity to make amends. The passage is a reminder that we owe our\r\nfellow humankind some responsibilities, especially those who need our help in any\r\nform. In order to avoid the same punishment and curses which was pronounced on the\r\nwicked for failing to help others, we should regularly pay attention to the needs of\r\npeople particularly the underprivileged in our midst. This is important because\r\nwhatever we do for them is done for Jesus Christ who will reward us according to our\r\ndeeds. <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> To what extent do you think selfishness can affect one's faith in Jesus Christ? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\r\n        <li> How do we identify those who are actually in need, especially these days when\r\nlazy people go about pretending that they are in need? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\r\n      \r\n        <\/ol>\r\n\r\n        <\/li>\r\n\r\n        <\/ol>\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h4> Prayer Points <\/h4>\r\n        <ul>\r\n        <li> Thank God for the love He has bestowed on you through Jesus Christ. <\/li> <!-- Prayer Point 1-->\r\n        <li> Pray that you will be a channel of His love to the needy\/poor. <\/li> <!-- Prayer Point 2-->\r\n        <li> Pray that you will not live selfishly but bless the needy around you. <\/li> <!-- Prayer Point 3-->\r\n        <\/ul>\r\n\r\n             <h4> Fellowship and Ministry Building Activities <\/h4>\r\n        <ul>\r\n        <li> Role-play a scene in which a believer helps an unbeliever and then shares the\r\nGospel. <\/li> <!-- Fellowship Activity 1-->\r\n        <li> Discuss the likely results. <\/li> <!-- Fellowship Activity 2-->\r\n        <\/ul>\r\n\r\n           <h4> Take Home <\/h4>\r\n        \r\n        <ul>\r\n        \r\n        <li> God will surely judge the works of men. <\/li> <!-- Take Home 1-->\r\n        <li> God frowns at selfishness because it is an invitation to everlasting punishment. <\/li> <!-- Take Home 2-->\r\n        <li> Jesus recognises the kindness done to people. <\/li> <!-- Take Home 2-->\r\n        <li> Believers should demonstrate their love to God through care and hospitality. <\/li> <!-- Take Home 2-->\r\n        <li> Faith and works are inseparable. <\/li> <!-- Take Home 2-->\r\n        \r\n        <\/ul><\/p>"}]
